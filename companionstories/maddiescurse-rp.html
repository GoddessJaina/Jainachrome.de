		<h1>Maddie's Curse</h1>
		<div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera sighs as she examines the sprawling subway map on the brick wall. She pushes down on her blue crescent moon hair clip in her black hair.
		<p>
		Vera realizes that she loves driving. A rental vehicle gives her broad choice for direction, freedom of speed, and utter privacy. A subway train, on the other hand, is stuffy. It's like waiting in one of Town's submarine pods, waiting to arrive at a port, but with all the quality of life of a can of sardines.
		<p>
		She sighs, skims again her assignment briefing notes on her Town-issued tablet, and boards the gray line. It's better for the environment, anyway, and the roads in this city are gummed up. 
		<p>
		Some minutes later, she walks out behind a small mob of passengers and then walks into a quiet, deserted stretch of the subway tunnels.
		<p>
		The cat-girl lived somewhere here, somehow.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		Alone, in a dimly lit section of the tunnels, it is silent apart from the distant sound of subway cars moving along other tunnels. However, from around a bend down the tracks, a faint sound echoes. A small, shiny object, about the size of a coin, catches on the light from the electric lamps lining the walls of the tunnel. It rolls to a stop, falling flat on the ground just in front of the bend in the tunnel. 
		<p>
		Then, it is once again quiet, with only the low hum of the lamps to keep Vera company.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		The field researcher walks along the decommissioned rail after the faint flash of the coin, watching her back every dozen steps. As usual, she's trespassing. The potential lead, however, is too great to pass.
		<p>
		As she approaches the bend, Vera reaches into her white sash over her white, dressy shirt and primes the trigger to her taser. She inhales sharply, leaning on the tunnel wall, and she then snaps herself around the corner.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The stretch of tunnel around the bend is equally deserted. One object catches her eye, however: a metal panel with slats on it, quickly recognizable as the cover for a vent. It matches the fairly large vents spaced out in intervals throughout the subway system, which are placed several feet off the ground. 
		<p>
		Past the fallen panel, a sparse trail of similar coins leads into the darkness. Being decommissioned, the city doesn't bother to keep the lighting on this far from the active tracks.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		The field researcher stares into the deep of the tunnel, and she shivers. She removes her tablet and her taser from her sash, one into each hand, and she shines her tablet's flashlight feature into the expanse to little effect. Still, she presses forward along the trail of coins. She's not afraid of the dark.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		Finally, reaching the end of the trail of coins, Vera finds a vent missing its cover. The choking darkness of the tunnel does not relent to her flashlight, and it is similarly dark peering down the vent. 
		<p>
		Then Vera hears the faint scuffle of a shoe on concrete behind her, and a mere moment later, feels a hand wrap around her wrist, firmly stopping her from aiming her taser. 
		<p>
		"Hehe. You really weren't very hard to catch, you literally fell for a trail of shiny objects."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Her wrist struggles with a strength that should come as surprising to the stranger. She steps around in a tight circle, and she searches for a face in this void.
		<p>
		“Let me go. Let me go right now! Who are you?”
		<p>
		She then flicks her tablet flashlight in the direction of the arm. She frowns at what she sees, and she says with her more standard deliberation, “I won't hurt you. I've come here simply to meet you. I knew those coins would lead to something...”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		She feels the grip on her wrist tighten in response to her struggling as sharp nails dig into her skin.  
		<p>
		As the light flashes onto the face of her aggressor, she sees a dark haired young woman wearing a red bandana peering back at her, although her attention is quickly drawn to the two cat ears atop her head. This was definitely the person she was looking for.
		<p>
		"Hmm... I'd love to chat! Although I think you should drop the taser, you probably won't be needing it."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera is fascinated, too, by the cat-like eyes of the woman. Magical beings such as this one would always seem to come up in her routine assignments. Maybe she has an advantage in the form of night vision?
		<p>
		"That taser is merely for self-defense. What's your name?"
		<p>
		She stares at the cat girl blankly, and sometimes anxiously. And eventually she concedes to letting go of the taser, letting it clack against a metal beam. A blue spark, in that moment, bridges from the tip of the weapon into the metal beam.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Me? I'm Maddie! Nice to meet you, office lady. Do you have a name too?"
		<p>
		Then, distracted by the taser arcing blue electricity across the pipe, Maddie looks down with wide eyes.
		<p>
		"That taser looks really fun, you should let me play around with it sometime!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“I'm Vera. I'm not an office lady; I'm a field researcher.”
		<p>
		She sighs, and she shakes her head. “Please, let go of me, Maddie. And let's go somewhere else. I can't see anything. Why are you here, anyway?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Meh. I was bored and wanted to hang out in the tunnels a bit. I like watching the trains go by. Then I saw your prowling around and thought it'd be funny to lure you in."  
		<p>
		Maddie cocks her head and looks at Vera quizzically. 
		<p>
		"Why are you in the subway system looking for a catgirl if you're a 'field researcher’? Aren't you supposed to be in the countryside researching fields?"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Well, thank you for catching my attention.”
		<p>
		She rolls her eyes. She then tries to walk with Maddie, blindly, dismissing her taser. She could get it later.
		<p>
		“I understand that you're not interested in letting go of me? Okay. Let us out of here. And please, a 'field researcher' where I'm from refers to an agent that is sent out on assignments for information gathering, especially through extensive investigations. You've been—causing interest in this city.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie, realizing that Vera probably isn't trying to do anything to harm her at this point, lets go of Vera's arm. Beginning to walk further into the tunnel, Maddie gestures for Vera to follow.
		<p>
		"Ehehehe. I'm glad to hear people are enjoying my mischief. It's quite fun, you should really try it sometime! Yeah, I can lead us out of here. But not the way you came; let's walk in the dark for a bit. It'll be fun!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera sidesteps from Maddie with this opportunity, creating space. She stops to glance back at her taser nearby, but she shakes her head and continues on with her.
		<p>
		“I'm more interested in protocol, Maddie, if I can help it. I'll follow you in the dark, though, okay.”
		<p>
		Vera clutches her tablet against her shirt, and she bites her lip.
		<p>
		“Why do you conduct 'mischief', if I may inquire? Is it really just for fun? I'm not sure, for example, stealing should fall under that umbrella.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Why? 'Cause it's fun. And there's not much else for me to do. What am I supposed to do, sit at a desk for 8 hours a day until I die? I'd much rather do whatever I want. Also, what you would call 'stealing', I would call 'liberating food trapped in the Flormart.' If the food didn't want me to have it, then why is it so easy to grab?"
		<p>
		Maddie chuckles, continuing to walk down the tunnel. There's no sign of another end, only pitch darkness. Although Maddie seems perfectly fine walking with no light as Vera follows along with her tablet's flashlight.
		<p>
		"But you wouldn't understand. You wouldn't get the joys of tomfoolery unless you tried it."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“There's a difference between individual freedom and repeating minor crime. Fortunately, I'm willing to help you understand the difference.”
		<p>
		The image of typing into her notes “finds committing petty crime entertaining” dissatisfies Vera. Town had the understanding this catgirl likely had some greater motive and, in any case, wanted Vera to get to the source. She could perhaps guide Maddie away from repeating her 'misbehavior'?
		<p>
		“Let me present you a hypothetical. Suppose you own a small business, and suppose I'm a customer in your small business. If I confiscated your merchandise and claimed something like, 'they seemed lonely,' how would you feel?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Owning a small business sounds really boring, I don't think I would do that. Instead, let me ask you this: How would you feel if you were hungry and saw a really tasty looking rotisserie chicken? Why should you have to stay hungry? Just eat it, you need the food to keep living after all."
		<p>
		Maddie pulls out a bag of chips and begins crunching on them as she continues walking. 
		<p>
		"Not like I have money to buy it anyways. I can't believe you want me to starve already, we just met!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“I don't want you to starve, Maddie. I'm humane. Furthermore, I'm sorry you don't have money.”
		<p>
		The sound of the munching is accompanied by Vera then tapping her tablet screen for her notes application. Vera wishes economic disparity wasn't, in her exploration, such a huge watermark of the world's culture and issues.
		<p>
		“Okay. Maddie, tell me about your background. In what kind of community were you raised? What are your other day-to-day tasks today?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Wow. You really ask a lot of questions; I purposefully cause trouble and I'm somehow less annoying than you are. Sure, here's the short of it. I don't really remember much of my parents. That was a long time ago. I do remember wandering off one day and finding a stray cat. I tried to pet it, and it bit me. It kinda hurt but I was fine."
		<p>
		Maddie stops dead in her tracks, and spins around to face Vera. She flashes a big grin, her fangs visible in the light from Vera's tablet. She then begins stepping towards Vera. 
		<p>
		"You know, I guess I could show you what happened. I think it'll be helpful for your 'document' or whatever you're writing about me."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She rubs her forehead.
		<p>
		“I get called annoying often. Anyway... That's unfortunate. Why are you—looking at me like that? Maddie?”
		<p>
		Vera steps backwards as Maddie approaches her, and then she flashes panic as she thumbs through her device for the emergency notification service.
		<p>
		“Show me what? W-What does a stray cat have to do with anything? What are you doing?”
		<p>
		Vera suddenly bolts in a wide arch around the catgirl.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Try as Vera might, Maddie, unsurprisingly, has the reflexes of a cat. She pounces directly at the other woman, knocking her to the ground. As Vera had been attempting to arc around Maddie, she had been between Maddie and the pit where the tracks are. As the catgirl collides with her, they both fall down into the pit, the tablet falling to the ground with the camera facing the floor, snuffing out what little light was in the room.
		<p>
		"Ehehehe. You're actually a lot like a rotisserie chicken, in the way that I want to take a nibble of both. Except unlike one, you're right in front of me."
		<p>
		In the dark, dazed from being knocked down onto the tracks, Vera cannot tell what's happening until she feels a stinging pain in her left shoulder. She then hears the sound of Maddie giggling once again.
		<p>
		"Don't worry, you'll be fine. I just really felt like making you shut up and this seemed like a great way to do it."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera gets a curse word in before she impacts the floor of the pit. Gravel has been piling up here for some time, and Vera groans out in pain even before the different sensation of the bite. She breathes thin, and she pushes Maddie off of her side and struggles to her feet. She lifts her tablet, and its tough screen is cracked. 
		<p>
		“What is your issue? I can understand an insult, and I can almost even understand attacking me, but biting too? Where is your self-control? How does this show me anything about you?”
		<p>
		So much for making her shut up. Vera's voice drips with venom but tapers with, again, fear. She barely walks on.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Hey, cats bite and scratch people all the time. You don't need to be so mad over it. And honestly, I think this will teach you much more about my situation than any explanation I could come up with."
		<p>
		Maddie quietly walks up to Vera, a bandage in her hand, probably pulled from the pouch on her belt. 
		<p>
		"Hold still. I won't bite you again, promise. I'm just going to stop the bleeding. I wanted a nibble, not a dead body."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		The field researcher stops moving and folds her arms. She's tense and silent for the duration of Maddie's first aid.
		<p>
		She then continues forward, and she mumbles, “Yeah, this has taught me cat people are prone to being more cat than human.” She says, louder, “I still don't understand what you mean by this educating me about you. Are you using sarcasm?”
		<p>
		Vera places the broken tablet into her sash. The flashlight had turned off, as did the screen lighting. She sighs.
		<p>
		“Please don't hurt me anymore, then. I'll cooperate. Please.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"I don't plan on hurting you anymore. I don't really like hurting people, in all honesty. Come, the end of this old tunnel is quite close."
		<p>
		Maddie leads the way, taking Vera's hand to guide her through the darkness. After a while longer of walking, it exits to an old abandoned station, in a quiet portion of the city. Surprisingly, it's quite overgrown, with golden light streaming in through numerous holes in the ceiling. A rusted old subway car lies on the tracks, immobile for who knows how long.
		<p>
		"This is my house! Come on, you look like you need to sit down."
		<p>
		As Maddie is walking through the station, she spots a child looking at them, a young boy no older than 10.
		<p>
		"Shouldn't you be going home soon, Jacob? It's getting late, you don't want to worry your mother!"
		<p>
		Although he looks disappointed at being told to leave, he begrudgingly complies, waving goodbye to Maddie and heading off out of sight.
		<p>
		"Sorry about that. I sometimes play with the local kids to keep them company."
		<p>
		Maddie chuckles.
		<p>
		"They say their parents never believe them when they tell them about a cat who's also a person."
		<p>
		Maddie leads Vera to the old subway, pushing open a door whose hinges were clearly attached to the frame with duct tape and effort. Inside, a surprisingly cozy space awaits. An old mattress lies in the corner, with a table and a pair of mismatched chairs set at it. 
		<p>
		"Here, have a seat or lie down. You can pick whatever."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She is much quieter, again. Maddie telling her to shut up, along with her impossible reaction time and speed, bobs at the top of Vera's mind. And she mulls over what questions she could have been asking, what way to clarify anything about the last several minutes...
		<p>
		Her eyes brighten at the exotic and well-lit scene, however. It's something out of an urban fantasy novel—a secret grove buried at the heart of a metropolis. Of course, it's also full of grime and mold and bugs and, really, the thought anyone could consider this a home begs questions about the health of her captor.
		<p>
		She watches the kid run away, and she says, “I have a lot of questions, Maddie.”
		<p>
		The mattress is inviting, even being her messy captor's bed. Vera's legs are sore. So, reluctantly, Vera lowers onto the mattress and rolls up the bottom of her white, utilitarian pants, checking herself for gashes with the granite. She can only find bruises here, and she'd refuse to show any more of her leg than this around Maddie.
		<p>
		She lowers her knee. “Thank you for showing me your home. If my tablet still worked, I'd be writing everything I see. For my job. Thanks for that.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"I've never actually bitten someone like that before. I usually know it's a very bad idea... but this time I just felt like I had to. Like a compulsion."
		<p>
		Maddie pulls out a couple of mugs from a box, filling them with water. She then carefully plugs a microwave into a shoddily crafted array of AA batteries, careful not to electrocute herself. She puts the mugs in, and, miraculously, the microwave hums as it warms up the water. She takes them out, adding a couple packets of hot chocolate powder from a brand new box of hot chocolate mix.
		<p>
		"Here, have something warm to drink. You probably are starting to feel a little bit woozy now."
		<p>
		Vera's head has been starting to ache mildly, not that she hit it very hard when she fell.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"The percentage of you that is cat took over your human reasoning, I'm sure."
		<p>
		Vera shuts one of her eyes as Maddie fiddles with the unregulated power unit with the microwave. She exhales only after the microwave turns back off, and she extends her hand for the mug of hot chocolate. She then stares into the drink. It is clean to her surprise—even with the powder having spread throughout, the water has no foul odor or color.
		<p>
		"I can confirm I feel strange. There's something you're not telling me. There is always something people don't tell me. Furthermore, I hope you have not lied to me yet. People also lie to me. Would you let me leave tomorrow, if I asked?" 
		<p>
		She rubs her forehead.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Well, now we run into the tricky issue that you know where I live, and whoever you work for that sent you to 'research' me will probably send more people after me. So I'm really not sure how to go about this."
		<p>
		Maddie gulps down half of her mug of hot chocolate in one continuous sip.
		<p>
		"You should sleep now, you'll probably feel better in the morning."
		<p>
		Vera is still woozy and also aching from her bruises and whatever has happened.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"I promise you I'm peaceful and that I'm the only person you'd be seeing from where I'm from."
		<p>
		Well, unless Vera doesn't indicate that she's alive for a while. There's a possibility, then, that the Field Research Department would send a couple of her coworkers. She sips from her hot chocolate beverage. It's fine.
		<p>
		"I understand you're still worried, however. Therefore—okay—I guess I'll be your prisoner. That is, likely, what you're implying. Maybe I will bore you soon enough."
		<p>
		Her assignments never seem to go to plan. She sighs and places the mug aside, and she lies on her back.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Well, make yourself comfortable for now. I'm going to go shopping once you're asleep, do you want me to get you anything?"
		<p>
		Maddie turns around, carefully unplugging the batteries from the microwave, and then sits down on the ladder-back chair, looking out one of the cracked but still solid windows of the train car.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera reaches into her sash again and removes about thirty dollars.  She waves them above her head.
		<p>
		"A delicious meal, please. Like a burger, or a nice steak, or shrimp scampi. Pay with this."
		<p>
		Maddie might get the idea to steal from her wallet, but assignment funds have been stolen before, and it's better than stealing from stores in Vera's name.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie snatches the money from her, stuffing it into a pouch.
		<p>
		"Steak sounds good. Let me go check if the grill is working; it's been a while since I got to have something that good. Usually the meat section has a lot of people around and it's hard to get a steak."
		<p>
		Maddie disappears out the door. As Vera is lying down trying to rest, she hears the sound of muffled clattering from outside and then hears a sound somewhere between a woman yelping and a cat meowing in surprise. Then, a string of curses. A few minutes later, Maddie reappears at the door.
		<p>
		 "Yeah, the grill's working fine. I'll be back in like an hour. Try to sleep a bit. I'll wake you up when the food is ready."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Maddie wanting to share the meal is unexpected to the field researcher. Town, she supposes, is odder in how its meals are highly individualized compared to the rest of the world—even odd for a petty thief, apparently. She huffs when Maddie returns.
		<p>
		"Okay. I won't be any help for grilling. I skipped the culinary electives. Did you burn yourself? Come back, please."
		<p>
		Vera finds herself falling asleep soon, which conflicts with her plan to at least snoop through the cat girl's possessions or even to run away to guaranteed safety. Oh well...
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		-----------------
		<br>
		Vera awakens a couple hours later to the sound of the door opening and the smell of freshly cooked steak as Maddie reenters the room. She seems to have gone in and out silently while Vera was sleeping as Maddie is currently wearing an apron that says "KISS THE COOK" that she probably had stored in the small wardrobe. The ‘COOK’ is crossed out and ‘cat’ is written under it in rough handwriting.
		<p>
		"Food's ready! Wake up, sleepyhead, take a seat at the table. Do you want some water with it? I got a bunch of water bottles while I was there."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera groans. It's like visiting her mother in Italy. She sits up, and a tiny smirk then crosses her lips, the first Maddie has seen. She sits at the table soon.
		<p>
		"Smells better than I considered it would. Did you season this, Maddie?—I would enjoy water to drink, yes. Thank you for feeding me."
		<p>
		The golden light from the ceiling of the station is mostly dimming now. They would be enveloped by moonlight or total darkness soon.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Yes, of course I seasoned it. Just because I don't really participate in society doesn't mean I'm a barbarian. It's pretty good, right?"
		<p>
		Maddie pours out a bottle of water into a glass, and sets it at the table.
		<p>
		"I'd say the steak came out pretty good." she says while chewing.
		<p>
		Maddie and Vera finish the meal, and Maddie pulls out a garden hose from where it's clipped to the ceiling, and opens a window. She begins spraying the plates clean with the hose, holding the plates out of the window so the water spills down to the gravel below the train. 
		<p>
		"You should really sleep for the night, I plan on doing it soon too. You can use the mattress; I'll curl up on the floor or something. Don't worry."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera confesses the steak is delicious. She's always had a slightly more carnivorous diet than some of her peers.
		<p>
		Sitting back on the mattress, Vera rotates her tablet in her hands and presses some of its discreet buttons. She sighs and places it back into her sash. And she grabs a tattered blanket she's been avoiding. Night is coming with a chill.
		<p>
		“I understand, Maddie, that you live here because it's inexpensive? I'm concerned it's missing some amenities. And, anyway, I have another question, probably more important. Why did you bring up the anecdote about the stray cat? I can't stop thinking about it. It seems—mundane.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"I don't know. I guess it reminded me of my current situation. I kind of just live out in the city, I'm also a cat to some degree. Maybe I remember the bite so well because it kind of reminds me of how I sometimes have a bit of a negative response to people. Like you saw. But I think you should go to sleep now. You can worry more in the morning..."
		<p>
		Maddie yawns, stretches, and then curls up in a large cardboard box in the corner of the room. It's padded with blankets and old cushions and to Vera looks surprisingly comfortable. 
		<p>
		"I'm going to sleep now. See ya in the morning."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Alright. Thank you for answering me. I find this interesting. Goodnight.”
		<p>
		Vera lies still in the bed, patiently expecting Maddie to fall asleep while wracked with thoughts. Any attempt to sneak out would be probably foiled by the shoddy door for the subway car and Maddie's cat-like senses. That alone would be acceptable, maybe, but she doesn't want to destroy her image of being compliant and possibly harmless to someone who has quickly thrown her off her feet before. She could rummage quieter than the door hinge through Maddie's possessions, then. Although it is less delving into some deep insight for her job and more, well, acting petty to her captor.
		<p>
		So, Vera rolls onto her side, staring at the wall long enough that she can relax enough to fall asleep again. She despises sleeping in the same room as others.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		-----------------
		<br>
		When Vera awakens in the morning, she is immediately greeted by the sight of the catgirl looming over her, staring down at her.
		<p>
		"Finally, you're awake. I've been waiting for you to wake up for a while now. I think you look pretty cute like this, honestly."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Goosebumps form all across Vera's skin, and she reels backwards onto the pillow, her hair falling over her eyes.
		<p>
		“What? Please don't do that! S-Staring at me while I'm sleeping, or saying that, I'm referring to.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Oh, that's not what I meant. I think you'll find what you see to be pretty funny, actually."
		<p>
		Maddie pulls out a scratched old hand mirror with a slight crack in the middle. As Vera gazes into the mirror, to her horror, she has a pair of cat ears atop her head, her human ears gone. The ears are the same color as her hair, and have a bit of fluff to them.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		All the color from Vera's face drains, and she screams in a higher octave than she'd ever speak. She snatches the mirror off of Maddie and pats down where her human ears used to be and where these new ones apparently are, shivering at the weird sensation of the fur not at all analogous to her other human features.
		<p>
		“What the hell have you done to me? Change me back! Please, you—lunatic, why?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Well... that was the whole thing with the bite."
		<p>
		Maddie giggles.
		<p>
		"I'm cursed! Why do you think I would've mentioned being bitten by a weird stray cat, and then biting you afterwards? You were asking so many questions about me, I figured the best way to show you would be to bite you and let you figure it out firsthand. In hindsight, that probably wasn't the best way to go about doing it, but it's pretty funny so I don't regret it."
		<p>
		Maddie reaches down to Vera and pets her new tail. 
		<p>
		"Oh yeah, you have this now. It's actually pretty fun to have, I think you'll come to enjoy it! Also, I'm not entirely sure how to, uh, uncat you. You're pretty smart though so I'm sure you'll figure out how."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera shakes her head over and over, and her black, sleek tail awkwardly dips away from Maddie's touch. She stands up from the bed, then, and paces around the room, her hands curled into fists.
		<p>
		“Of course you're cursed—why didn't I think of that? Don't answer that, I don't want to hear it. You're right: this is far from the best way you could have shown me your personal history. I've engaged with too many magical beings playing tricks on me—and now this innocent assignment has transformed me into a cat person! I'll never hear the end of it. I'm figuring this out immediately. I'm not okay with this.”
		<p>
		She sits down abruptly on the smaller of the two chairs. She closes her eyes. “What do you know about turning me back to normal?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Hey hey hey, calm down a bit! I really don't know how to change you back. I just got bitten by that cat one day when I was a kid and just... lived with it ever since. I'm not too sad over it, it really isn't bad. Plus being able to see well in the dark is neat!"
		<p>
		Maddie opens a cooler with another cooler inside of it, with an even smaller cooler inside of that one, eventually pulling out a miraculously still frozen breakfast sandwich, which she unwraps and puts in the microwave.
		<p>
		"Here, have some breakfast. We can try to figure out a solution when you're less hungry."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Maddie, I'm an adult woman with a job for a guarded society. Even if they allow me back inside its borders, I'll be mocked forever. Forever. I don't want this.”
		<p>
		The visual comedy of the coolers is lost to Vera. She unfurls her fists so that she can press her face into her palms. Her new left ear twitches.
		<p>
		“Give me kibble and milk, that'll cheer me up. That's a lie. Just... Okay, let's work together. You're my best odds here. Please.”
		<p>
		Vera takes the sandwich at the soonest opportunity from the microwave. She eats it quickly, although she ate a lot last night too.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie paces around the room, and stops to look out the window at the morning sun shining through a hole in the ceiling.
		<p>
		"Well, you said you've dealt with magical creatures a lot before, right? Surely you've dealt with a cursed person before; do you have any experience with fixing something like that?"
		<p>
		Maddie pulls out a slightly stale chunk of bread and begins munching, as she moves over to the other chair and sits facing Vera.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera sighs. She'd rather not bother with finding something to brush her hair with. She stares at Maddie.
		<p>
		“No. No personal experience, I mean. Shape has told me anecdotes of people with curses, and what I understand is that they are inconsistent. Magic, at large, is inconsistent. If we find the right person it could be trivial to fix or essentially impossible. However, how do we find the right person? I can't even contact Shape. He's been missing for about two months. I doubt that's changed. And some curses are based on time. I don't want to wait and be trapped like this or have it become worse.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie puts an elbow on the table, and then rests her chin on her palm, thinking. 
		<p>
		"I really don't know how the curse works. I've only spread it to one other person before you, and it was how I learned about the way it spreads. A couple years ago I met this girl, and she hung out with me for a while one evening... things escalated a bit, and, uh, I kind of bit her. She really wanted me to bite her, we were having a nice time together. If you know what I mean."
		<p>
		Maddie, clearly lost in thought, stares off into space for a moment.
		<p>
		"I hope she's doing well. I miss her. But in terms of knowing who actually can fix this... not a clue. Why don't we go outside and get some fresh air now that you've calmed down. We can take a walk through the city; it'll be fun!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"Your story is appreciated, Maddie. I wish, however, it gave us more information we could work with. I suppose it informs us that we should not bite someone. Maybe this curse spreads through blood? Shape always tells me his blood carries his magic."
		<p>
		She buries her head into her arms on the table. Her tail drags down.
		<p>
		"There's no chance I'm going outside in a public space like this. I wouldn't for fun, either. You'll take me straight to somewhere where we can begin to investigate who can help me. And I'll need a big coat to hide—this."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Meh. I don't really bother hiding it; people just assume I'm just a person who thinks it's funny or cute to walk around like I'm cosplaying a catgirl. I make sure no one can see under my hair and realize that I don't have human ears. As long as I keep my tail down so it looks like it's fake. It's a bit awkward, but hey, better to have people think I'm just crazy than for them to realize I'm both crazy and unnatural!"
		<p>
		Maddie digs around the wardrobe, pulling out a beanie and a large raincoat. She walks over to Vera and tries to pop the hat onto her over her ears, but it falls off.
		<p>
		"Hm. This might be a bit of an issue. Not quite sure what to do with your ears. Although you look so adorable like this I think you should just rock the look."
		<p>
		Vera's ears perk up reflexively upon being told she looks ‘adorable’.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"Flattery will not improve my mood about any of this, Maddie. You did this to me, after all."
		<p>
		Vera also tries fitting the beanie on herself. And, while the raincoat prevents her tail from being obvious, there's still the impression of a tail on its fabric.
		<p>
		Vera grimaces, showing her teeth. Four of her existing teeth became savage fangs overnight.
		<p>
		"I hope nobody will recognize me. I don't really feel like going, but I need to find help."
		<p>
		She stands up and steps outside the door, maintaining a stare at the ground. Her white uniform has stains from sleeping on the old mattress with it.
		<p>
		"We can go. Lead me downtown, please. Lie about who I am when necessary today."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Hmm. We'll need to think of a fake name for you. We can do that later, though. When we go out, mostly keep to quiet streets and alleys. The less people, the better."
		<p>
		Maddie grimaces slightly with discomfort as she pushes her tail under a much smaller coat than Vera's and with ease that comes from years of practice. Then, she puts on a headband with holes for her ears so it looks like she's wearing fake cat ears.
		<p>
		"Alright, let's get going. Downtown shouldn't be too hard to reach; it's only about a 20 minute walk away."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She nods, and they head back into the abandon section of the subway where they had their first encounter.
		<p>
		The city is still crowded with the same traffic from yesterday, and even the side alleys are populated. Vera stands close behind Maddie in order to dissuade onlookers from closely examining her cat ears, and she sometimes bumps into Maddie. One man sitting at the steps to a set of doors flicks his cigarette by her feet, and Vera then pushes Maddie forward. She's not anywhere near as confident as yesterday.
		<p>
		“Is there a library or university nearby? I would envision magic users congregating there...”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"I don't usually go into places like that very much, as you could probably guess. I think there's a library in the downtown, but I'm not exactly sure where. I remember passing by it a few times, it looks like it's half castle and half modern glass box. Neat place."
		<p>
		Maddie looks around, checking down some alleys seemingly searching for something.
		<p>
		"Maybe if we can get onto a rooftop it'll be easier to find. I hope you like climbing!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Good idea. A building resembling a castle should capture the imagination of young magic users, at least. I assume you're not an avid reader? Where do you frequent here instead?”
		<p>
		Vera shakes her head, and she leans on a brown wall. Her tail curls away in her raincoat.
		<p>
		“Can't we just ask someone where the library is? I'm not climbing a big ladder. At least find us a stairwell.”
		<p>
		She stares up at a metal awning.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Ladder? Stairwell???" 
		<p>
		Maddie lifts her hands and curls her fingers slightly, showing her sharp, slightly oversized nails, a little reminiscent of a cat's claws. 
		<p>
		"I just climb the walls. There's usually enough little protrusions and the like to do so.  But if you really want to be boring, yes, I suppose we could just ask someone."
		<p>
		Maddie glances around, looking for a suitable passerby.
		<p>
		"Vera, you seem great at introductions. Go ask that lady over there for directions to the library."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera frowns. She examines her own fingers, and she exhales seeing that her fingernails haven't changed. 
		<p>
		“I don't want to climb any walls. I can't, see? Okay, I will be boring as you claim and ask her. Please just stand nearby.”
		<p>
		She approaches the older lady, and she waves with stiff muscles. The stranger glances behind Vera inexplicably, and then she says, “What?”
		<p>
		“Hello. I'm new to this area. Do you know where the library is? I have been informed it's half castle and half modern décor.”
		<p>
		“Go that way. Take a right at the breakfast café.” She walks away and her wrist shakes as she retrieves her purse from her shoulder.
		<p>
		Vera shrugs toward Maddie. “I believe she meant forward from here?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Yeah, that makes sense. I don't usually get such a cold reaction, maybe I'm just more trustworthy looking than you."
		<p>
		Maddie gives a mischievous grin.
		<p>
		"I'm very trustworthy, you know. I would never do something rash and dangerous."
		<p>
		Maddie begins walking down the street following the directions, turning back to make sure Vera is following her.
		<p>
		"C'mon, let's go check out the library. You're the one who wants to go there so badly after all. Although it'd be nice to stop at the cafe. I'm kinda thirsty."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera rolls her eyes and follows after Maddie.
		<p>
		"I suspect you're just fortunate with who you talk to. However, I'm here trying to trust you, so maybe you just are trustworthy, despite your appearance. Anyway, a drink of water could help us, yes. I won't need to show my identification, but if someone asks for who I am—the story is I'm Carrie, and that I'm visiting the area. Evidently, as well, I like cats. Unless you have a better lie?"
		<p>
		They arrive by the glass door to the cafe. She grabs Maddie's shoulder, delaying her from entering and allowing a young couple to slip out.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie waits for the couple to pass by and then continues on into the cafe. Then, realizing she doesn't have any money and that Vera probably wouldn't approve of stealing, she turns to her and quietly asks her,
		<p>
		"Hey, uh, v- Carrie, you're going to pay, right? I don't exactly have any money on me." 
		<p>
		Then, without even waiting for a response, she gently grabs Vera's arm and leads her to the cashier, clearly just wanting Vera to get on with it so she can get her drink. 
		<p>
		"Hiii can I get uhhh medium frozen hot chocolate?"
		<p>
		Then, she turns to Vera, waiting expectantly for her to order something.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She nods, and she faces the cashier with little fuss. That's what the money is for.
		<p>
		"I'll take a black coffee. Two cups of water in addition. The order is for Carrie."
		<p>
		The woman takes their order and Vera's cash, staring at their cat ears. She folds her hands and smiles.
		<p>
		"Oh, is the convention happening again already?"
		<p>
		Vera hazards a guess. "We wanted to—wear the costumes early." 
		<p>
		"They look good! They look cute."
		<p>
		Vera turns away and says, "Okay." She sits down at an empty little table nearby, and she shies from Maddie's attention.
		<p>
		"This is really embarrassing..."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie sits down next to her, and she smiles at Vera.
		<p>
		"I don't know, I think you look pretty cute wearing cat ears too. It's not that embarrassing, come on."
		<p>
		Maddie leans back, relaxing while she waits for her drink.
		<p>
		"Do you drink anything more exciting than black coffee? It's kind of boring in my opinion. Why don't you try something else for once? You seem to be having a lot of success trying out new horizons lately."
		<p>
		Maddie giggles, clearly enjoying teasing Vera.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera shakes her head, but her ears flick once and her tail stands and waves for several seconds.
		<p>
		"I'm not like that, Maddie. I'm not trying to be cute. I'm not trying to excite anyone. That's not the point of any of this. This costume is too many problems. And, please, it is bold of you to assume I don't ever order other caffeinated drinks... Are you familiar with the energy drink?"
		<p>
		She returns a weak, but genuine, smirk. Hers are fleeting. 
		<p>
		"I persisted with those during my career training courses."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie cocks her head, thinking.
		<p>
		"Hmm... I'm not sure if I've had one of those before. Actually, maybe that one time a few years ago when I had 13 cans of some drink in one afternoon and I couldn't stop moving for the next day and a half. Those might've been energy drinks."
		<p>
		Maddie looks and notices that their order is ready. She walks over, picks up the cups, and then sits back down and passes Vera her drink.
		<p>
		"I like hot chocolate. It's just tasty, there's not much more to it."
		<p>
		Maddie then takes a big slurp from her straw, clearly enjoying it immensely.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"You could have died, you know. You're only supposed to enjoy a maximum of three of those a day. One would be more medically acceptable... Read what the contents of the can are next time."
		<p>
		She sips from her coffee. She plants her elbows on the table, and she watches Maddie's glass empty.
		<p>
		"Black coffee is okay. Really, I simply need caffeine in the morning, and I don't have much of a 'sweet tooth'... Drink your water."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"I usually drink water. It's very accessible, compared to something like this. Plus if I drank hot chocolate consistently I'd probably end up dying getting the microwave plugged in. It's dangerous work, but very rewarding."
		<p>
		Maddie continues to slurp, not caring in the slightest about the obnoxious noise the straw is making. 
		<p>
		"Caffeinated things tend to just make me a bit too hyper. I usually try to avoid them."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"You're reasonable when you want to be, Maddie. I believed you were simply ignorant to the fire hazard that thing posed, but now I know you're simply reckless in favor of treats. Likewise, you're right to avoid that family of drinks."
		<p>
		Vera's new ears are more sensitive, so she downs her cup of water and then sidesteps from the table with her coffee.
		<p>
		"We're done talking. The library will help us end this soon enough. 'This' being this costume."
		<p>
		She leads them around the corner outside the cafe. The impressive glass box area of the library is close, after all.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie gives a smile and a wave to the cashier before following Vera outside. Down the street, they see the library, the glass part facing the side of the street that they are on. They walk down the street without issue, Maddie silently following Vera as they approach.
		<p>
		"Aaand here we are! Boring building full of books. I'm not quite sure what we're actually going to find here that's helpful, but I'll just follow you around and act like I'm helping. I'm very helpful when I try."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		The library interior is massive. Rows of shelves have considerable distance in-between, and yet most genres are represented. A second floor is accessible by elevator and stairway, and off to the far left is the other large area of the library mimicking a European castle. Vera, however, laps the wall of this glass area, reading the several pinned papers and notes from employees as well as library visitors in the more dedicated bulletin boards. She sighs. 
		<p>
		"My society has many bulletins resembling this one and even some digital examples. Unfortunately, much like theirs, I can locate no information pertaining to magic."
		<p>
		She asks the desk clerk if she can dial a phone number. It rings dead.
		<p>
		"Do you want to try something, Maddie?" The field researcher rubs her temples, frustrated.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Why don't we go look in the castley part of the library. That's where a wizard would probably be. I bet they'll be pondering an orb or something."
		<p>
		Maddie puts her hands together excitedly, clearly lost in the idea of meeting a stereotypical wizard.
		<p>
		"Maybe they'll have a magic staff and stuff! Maybe they'll even teach me how to be a wizard! Come on, let’s go look!"
		<p>
		Maddie pulls Vera by the arm towards the medieval-looking part of the library, so excited that her tail threatens to slip from the coat.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"I suppose that was the original plan we had in mind. However, allow me to interact first with any wizards we meet. I'm not convinced they will be as friendly to delve in their arcana as you believe."
		<p>
		She comes along by Maddie's side, then, amused by the catgirl's imagination. Vera had similar perceptions of what the magical world resembled when she was just starting her training. Modern, civilian books and movies are guesswork at best, it turns out.
		<p>
		The large room is dark and moody for a library, almost resembling a cavern more than a castle. There are frequent lamps that resemble candle lights by different chairs, sofas, and desks, however. Vera quickly resumes scanning the postings even across unlit sections of wall.
		<p>
		"You may grab a book if you want," She says.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie look around, seeing if there's anyone else in the room. Disappointed by the lack of wizards, or anyone in particular, she starts scanning the shelves. After a few moments, she stops abruptly while looking at the books.
		<p>
		"I just realized... it's been over 10 years since I last read a book. I'm not even sure if I remember how to read a book at this point..."
		<p>
		She walks over to Vera again, cocking her head in thought.
		<p>
		"You're a nerd, why don't you find a book."
		<p>
		Vera normally would easily be able to quickly look through the shelves and mentally pick out books that might be useful, but today she feels overwhelmed by the vast shelves of books. Concentrating in general has become harder as the morning has gone on, she has noticed.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera crosses her arms and shakes her head. With growing urgency, she then plucks out some books individually to read the title and back of. They're little use for her, even if she wasn't hexed.
		<p>
		“Maddie, I think I'm getting really stressed out, probably. Are we even in the right section...? None of the postings got me anywhere, so we'll need something else. Ideally a book discussing magic or a magic user. They must have something.”
		<p>
		Vera breathes in deeply and shoves the books arbitrarily into gaps in the nearest bookshelf. Most are not even in the right category anymore. She walks out of the aisle.
		<p>
		“Anyway, I'm sorry you might not be able to read books anymore. Furthermore, while reading is something I enjoy sometimes, I don't really intend my visit to last long enough to justify reading, for example, fiction.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie follows Vera out of the aisle, looking around for books that stand out. 
		<p>
		"So... are we looking for books that look like they have arcane sigils or something on them? Magicy looking stuff?"
		<p>
		She looks up, and sees a deep purple book high on one of the shelves, about 10 feet off the ground. Rather than looking for a ladder, Maddie simply walks up and hooks her fingers around one of the shelves as if testing if it would topple if she climbed on it.
		<p>
		"Hm. That book up there looks magic looking. Want to go get that one? I can climb up, unless you want to go up and get it."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Yes, 'magic-y looking stuff,' as you would phrase it.”
		<p>
		Vera shares a toothy smirk up at the book Maddie singled out. She, too, places her hand on the shelf, lightly shaking it. It's firm.
		<p>
		“What kind of library keeps books on shelves that high? Just another example of our bad luck. No matter, I'll grab it.”
		<p>
		She closes her eyes, washing out this overstimulation of the library's offerings again. And she plants her shoes on top of an empty pocket of the lowest shelf off the ground. She's pleased, and she then drops a few novels and a manuscript onto the floor to make room for her next step up the shelf.
		<p>
		Unfortunately, while the shelf itself holds, its supports pop on both sides, and it crashes down to the ground with all of its contents in one brief flurry of pages.
		<p>
		“Why did I ever think that would work?” She grabs her own head and pulls on it. An audience of a few people gathers at the end of the aisle, including a library staff member. “Please, this can't be happening—”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie, watching the disaster unfold, reacts quickly. She grabs Vera's arm as she's panicking and begins to pull her with her, away from the growing group of onlookers.
		<p>
		"We have to get the fuck out of here, come on. I have no idea why you would do something that stupid, but please just move."
		<p>
		Maddie pulls her along, trying to escape the library as quickly as possible. Worried about moving in such a hurry, Maddie glances back at Vera and herself to check if their tails have accidentally poked out from under their coats. To her horror, Vera's tail, unaccustomed to being tucked beneath a coat, has slipped out from under it, waving far too naturally from the lower part of her coat. There are still people turning to see the commotion as they rush out of the library.
		<p>
		"Come on, let's just go. Keep moving please."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“You're the one who said I could go up and get it! Whose stupid idea was that?”
		<p>
		A low growl bubbles from Vera's throat, but she coordinates with Maddie's escape. They run through the front door of the castle themed area of the library, and they dart into a side alleyway after passing by a couple of small businesses.
		<p>
		She frowns, stares into Maddie's feline eyes, and pushes the woman backwards into a stumble. She watches her fingers curl up afterwards, like a paw.
		<p>
		“Maddie, I hate you. Obviously this curse isn't just a cosmetic change. And I could be stuck like this forever. I'm going to be, regardless, at this rate.”
		<p>
		She sniffles.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie catches her balance, and over at Vera, noting that her eyes now looked as feline as her own. 
		<p>
		"I... I really didn't know it did that much. I didn't expect it to do so much to you. I don't even know where to begin on fixing this. I've never been able to so much as consider it, every day for me is just focusing on surviving until the next. I don't have a real home, I don't have a reliable source of food and drink. I just hope that I can keep living as I do. Biting you was a panic decision, I had to deal with you somehow and it was the fastest way to do that. I'm sorry if you get stuck like this. Maybe you'll just have to learn to live with it."
		<p>
		Maddie looks down, no longer willing to make eye contact. She takes a deep breath, trying not to succumb to Vera's infectious panic. 
		<p>
		"But I do have to try to help you now. Both because if you get taken or whatever they'd do to a cursed cat person, they'll probably get me too. And also, because it's the least I can do after what I did to you. I'm sorry."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera rubs her eyes with her knuckles. She walks deeper into the alley, and she removes her raincoat. Her tail thrashes about.
		<p>
		“You don't seem to know anything, Maddie... I wish this could all be over like a bad dream. Regardless, I hear you, and—I'm going to make sure you have a lunch and dinner every day, as long as I'm here. You should be sorry, however. You should have done something else. I would have a hard time adjusting to this state of being. It'd take years. I'm not kidding you when I suggest I'm unsure I would be accepted home, either. Even if I lied about the infectious nature of my being, it wouldn't change that I know I could infect my peers someday. I'm not willing to put Town at risk of this curse. So I'm staying here unless—no, until I'm cured.”
		<p>
		She reaches the wall at the end of the alley. She grabs her own shoulders and slides her back down the wall.
		<p>
		“Just take me to the subway again and don't talk to me.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Alright... although we can't move through the street with you... like that."
		<p>
		Maddie gestures to Vera's tail, free from the coat and waving, reflecting Vera's motions and thoughts.
		<p>
		"We'll need to find an alternate way back. Maybe we can climb a building, and go across rooftops until we find our way back."
		<p>
		Maddie glances up, looking for a suitable section of wall to climb. She sees a fire escape a few feet off the ground, leading up to the roof on the fifth floor.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera gazes at the section of the wall Maddie notices, and she tilts her head. Moments later, however, Vera slumps even lower on the wall and grabs her forehead.
		<p>
		“No. I can't climb anything, Maddie, if I can't climb a bookshelf. We should just wait until it's less crowded outside.”
		<p>
		She closes her eyes and starts to lie across the asphalt. It's unpleasant.
		<p>
		She can't help but to see herself as a woman in a monster's skin. Shape has a point about first impressions. Maybe Vera should stay out of sight.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie paces back and forth across the alleyway, her own tail freed and waving back and forth, reflecting her motions.
		<p>
		"We're in the downtown part of the city. It's not going to become less busy anytime soon; we can't sit here all day long."
		<p>
		Maddie stalks over to the moping woman. She reaches down, and shakes her shoulder.
		<p>
		"Get up. Just because this sucks doesn't mean you can be so whiny. Honestly? This is stupid. Let's just walk back to the subway. It's a big city, no one will remember us or care in the slightest."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera grumbles and collects herself from the floor. She grabs her tail in her hand, studying it. It's not fluffy. 
		<p>
		“I've earned the right to be whiny. I'm going to remind you that I don't really feel like talking, and that this is all your fault. Okay, though, let's walk back. Call me Carrie if anyone asks, obviously.”
		<p>
		The cat girl then walks back out of the alley, not waiting for Maddie. Her chin dips down, her face follows the sidewalk, and her hands move to cover her ears.
		<p>
		The crowd notices her. Most are too bewildered to respond more than staring or even reaching for their camera. Some strangers start shouting, however.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie rolls her eyes, remaining in the shadows of the alley for a moment longer before darting out of the alleyway, running towards Vera. She grabs her arm, pulling her with her away from the crowd of onlookers, down the busy street. 
		<p>
		"You're just about as stupid as I am, huh. Come on, safety's not too far away. Just run with me."
		<p>
		Maddie pushes through crowds, not caring about the onlookers and running through active traffic, barely avoiding people and cars alike.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"I'm not an idiot!” Vera pants. She darts along with Maddie, somehow maintaining her quick pace. She presses down on her ears, and she tries to just focus on what's directly in front of them. She's threatened, again, by being overwhelmed...
		<p>
		Thankfully, no one at all halts them in their chaotic path to the subway entrance, and they slow down in the abandoned tracks leading up to Maddie's overgrown home. It's much brighter here in the tunnels than Vera remembers, however.
		<p>
		She tugs her arm away from Maddie. She wipes a tear from her eye and, after some minutes, she grabs a piece of equipment from the gravel. Her taser hasn't been confiscated or damaged. But she groans at it anyway.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		In the darkness, Maddie slowly and silently creeps up behind Vera, much like she did when they first met. However, this time, rather than grabbing her arm, Maddie gently puts a hand on top of Vera's head, patting and petting between her soft ears.
		<p>
		Normally, Vera would object to this sudden contact in such a situation, but it feels strangely calming and relaxing, and her worries, while not washed away, are eased. 
		<p>
		Maddie simply stays with her, gently petting her head wordlessly, soothing her.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Her muscles deflate, then, and her head limps backwards into Maddie's hand. A confused smile grows from her tight lips. And she hardly walks forward at all. 
		<p>
		The catgirl purrs and mews. Her tail grazes Maddie's stomach and side. Her ears twitch sometimes. Her taser dangles from just a few fingers.
		<p>
		Eventually, she mumbles, "At least this feels nice."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Seeing Vera has calmed down, Maddie begins to walk with her, bringing her down the tunnel towards the dilapidated station. 
		<p>
		"Let's get you back to the house. You look like you need to sit down and process all of this for a moment."
		<p>
		Maddie's tail brushes against Vera's, an interesting sensation for Vera and one that Maddie hasn't felt in a long time, having not interacted with another catperson in years. 
		<p>
		She walks back to the station with Vera, and Maddie once again leads her inside of the carriage.
		<p>
		"Do you want something to eat or drink? I don't know if I can go out and get more things with the chaos we caused, but I can try to get you something."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera nods, and she walks always within Maddie's reach. Vera isn't even really sure why cats have tails to begin with, but maybe one reason is because it assists cats in communicating nonverbally with their peers?
		<p>
		In the subway car, Vera sits down on the mattress, places her taser to her bedside, and plants her cheeks to her curled up fingers. It's almost an impression of ignoring her fellow cat girl, but she then follows through with an answer.
		<p>
		“I'm not that hungry. It's okay. Thank you for helping me back here.”
		<p>
		Although Vera did not and does not want the first-hand experience, she has today now anyway. This is life in a city as a different sapient species from humans.
		<p>
		“Actually, Maddie, do you happen to have a writing instrument and paper?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie stops and thinks, racking her brain trying to remember if she has anything like that.
		<p>
		"Hm. Let me check the boxes. They're full of random stuff I've collected over the years."
		<p>
		Maddie steps over to the back corner of the room, and begins digging through an impressively large pile of boxes. Eventually, she lets out a triumphant "Ah!" and tosses something to Vera.
		<p>
		It's a pink pen, with a weird smiley face drawn on a small sphere attached to the back of the pen.
		<p>
		"I've never actually used it. It was called a ‘Keerbo Pen’ whatever that means, I just grabbed it because I thought it was cute. Now let me find some paper."
		<p>
		Maddie digs around some more, eventually pulling out an entire pile of blank printing paper.
		<p>
		"Here we go, I nabbed these from an office building. I was bored and saw people using the printer, so I snuck in and took out all the paper as a prank. They got so confused when they had no paper in a printer they had just restocked!"
		<p>
		Maddie walks over to Vera and plops down the papers, seemingly satisfied with her handiwork.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera catches the pen. She squishes the pink ball of the pen between her thumb and index finger, and it squeaks. She shakes her head, then. As soon as the papers are at her feet, she presses one of the pages against the back of her busted tablet and writes furiously.
		<p>
		"Thank you, Maddie. I would say to not steal from an office, however I find on many of my assignments that offices have some of my most important intel. So, anyway, I'm documenting mostly what I've learned about your curse of becoming a catgirl, about you, and about how it's affecting me... I suppose this is how I want to process this, making notes, as I always do."
		<p>
		Vera writes slower, however, than when she types on her keyboard on her tablet. And she reviews her writing even more slowly than the writing itself. She bites her lip.
		<p>
		"What were you like before you got bit by the cat?"
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie stops and cocks her head, thinking back.
		<p>
		"I... don't remember much. I was pretty young, but I think I always was a bit chaotic, even before the curse. I got into trouble fairly often; that's actually what I was doing when I found the cat."
		<p>
		Maddie turns to the microwave, once again preparing it for use.
		<p>
		"So yeah. I don't know if the curse changed me as much as it changed you. The real reason I live alone like this is because... my parents kicked me out when they saw what happened to me. Thought I was a demon or something, they screamed at me. Threw me away. But hey, I'm better off without them now I suppose."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"The curse hasn't changed the way I behave dramatically, has it?—Other than, well, apparently making it harder for me to read... I suppose I'm going to stop proofreading soon. Who should care about a few typos?"
		<p>
		She groans, though, and she stops writing to address Maddie with more focus. Staring at what she wants to think about works better now. Vera's black hair hasn't been brushed since this all began.
		<p>
		"I'm sorry your parents rejected you after your transformation. I wonder if my own mother and father would have done the same. I can assure you that you're much better than a monster. The truth is that I still intend to help you when I'm fully human again."
		<p>
		Vera's tongue slightly peeks past her lips as she continues writing.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie looks at Vera, slightly confused.
		<p>
		"What do you mean by 'help' me? I can't exactly just become a part of society. I don't think money or whatever you have will solve that." 
		<p>
		Maddie finishes fixing the microwave, and puts in a piece of steak from the night before. The microwave sparks for a moment and then hums to life.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera shrugs.
		<p>
		“If we figure out how to cure me of the curse, we'll probably figure out how to cure you too. That should work.”
		<p>
		The field researcher cups her chin and blinks slowly. She then shoves aside the stack of papers, and she lies on her stomach. Her tail wiggles behind her.
		<p>
		“Okay. That should be good for the present moment. That's not even all my recent thoughts on paper, but I—need a break. A break to do what exactly?”
		<p>
		Her low growl fills the railcar.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"I don't know what you want a break for. Why don't you take a nap or something? Maybe you should lie down for a bit; it's been a pretty hectic day so far."
		<p>
		Maddie puts her steak on a plate, and moves over to the table. She begins eating, enjoying the delicious microwaved meal.
		<p>
		"Plus you'll look really cute napping. I'll probably nap as well, I do it pretty often. Probably a bit of a cat thing."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera's ears automatically register the compliment with a perk. She grabs the pillow behind her on the mattress and digs her nose into it, apparently content to sleep on her chest after all.
		<p>
		"Some refer to it colloquially as a 'catnap,' after all. I likely have no other choice. Even my coffee earlier couldn't save me from this, it seems."
		<p>
		She guides the blanket over her back, and she yawns.
		<p>
		"Maddie, I'm choosing to trust you. I think I'm still changing. Please don't let me do anything stupid. I need to stay focused. If you have to put me on a leash, please don't hesitate. I'm serious."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"You'll be fine. I've been cursed for over a decade and I'm okay. Don't worry, we'll get you returned to how you were soon enough."
		<p>
		Maddie, having finished her meal now, walks over and sits down next to Vera.
		<p>
		"Just rest now... you will need it," Maddie says in a soothing tone.
		<p>
		She gently pets Vera along her back, comforting her. It helps her fall asleep.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She nods, lazily. 
		<p>
		“Okay. Thank you, Maddie.”
		<p>
		Vera, physically comforted as a cat girl, sleeps easily.
		<p>
		-----------------
		<br>
		Dusk approaches by the time Vera is awake again. She stretches out her limbs, and she steps from the mattress and right outside past the creaking door.
		<p>
		“Do you hear that, Maddie? That noise sounds like—music, far away.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie tilts her head, one ear perked up to listen closer for the music. Hearing the gentle melody, she follows Vera to the door.
		<p>
		"Yeah, I hear this occasionally. It comes from the tunnel where I met you, although I've never bothered to look for the source of it. I just listen to it and enjoy it, it's quite nice. If you want to go check it out, I'll go with you."
		<p>
		Maddie steps next to Vera, peering down the tunnel.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"As a field researcher, I love investigating even simpler matters like this. Follow me."
		<p>
		Vera detours back inside Maddie's home to fetch out her taser. She stuffs it inside her sash, and she walks quickly to the tunnel. It would be much darker for the source of the music than it is for Maddie and her, assuming the source is human. It's no wonder Maddie had the upper hand that faithful yesterday night.
		<p>
		A wireless speaker is playing the music, and an older teenager is strumming a guitar with much lower volume than the music. He mirrors the main romantic chords and melody, however. Vera doesn't recognize the song.
		<p>
		"Why is he playing that down here instead of any other place?"
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie peers over at the musician and then shrugs. Still out of earshot, Maddie turns to Vera.
		<p>
		"No idea. Maybe he just wants some privacy? It can be pretty busy in the city and sometimes people hang out in the tunnels near my home. Why don't you go talk to him? Or I can if you really want, you seem very scared to show yourself to people when you're like... this."
		<p>
		Maddie gestures to Vera's ears, her own tail waving a bit.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera sits on the ground nearby and slumps forward. She shields her cat ears with her hands. 
		<p>
		"I am scared, Maddie. I am. Convincing even one person to take me seriously is starting to resemble a nightmare. You can try talking to him, even if it was my idea to go here. Maybe he'll know something we don't."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Ah, fuck it. I'll go talk to him."
		<p>
		Maddie carefully walks towards the teenager, silently, and then changes to a normal walking pace once she gets closer. She makes no attempt to hide her approach as she walks over, ears and tail easily visible.
		<p>
		"Hey, what's up? Not often I see other people in this tunnel. Whatcha doin?"
		</div><div class="wrap Reese_w"><p>
		The teenager takes his pick off of his guitar, and his eyes widen. He speaks in a lower octave than one would guess. He turns off his speaker midsentence.
		<p>
		“Woah, hello there. Are you somehow a cat girl? Didn't really think those existed. Besides the point, uh, are you going to eat me?”
		<p>
		Vera rolls her eyes.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Yeah. I do exist, I don't really eat people, I usually eat steak from grocery store. It's free if you know what you're doing which is pretty cool. I was just wondering what someone like you was doing down here, I usually just go around here for fun cause it's near where I live."
		<p>
		Maddie walks up and looks at the speakers, feigning curiosity as she waits for a response.
		</div><div class="wrap Reese_w"><p>
		"Cool. I guess a lot of what I just said was kind of weird. Sorry. I'm just here for a similar reason you are. I like to practice my guitar down here for practice."
		<p>
		He shrugs, and he plays a couple chords on the guitar.
		<p>
		"I'm not a bother, am I? I could find somewhere else to practice if you want. Oh, I'm Reese, by the way. You live down here?"
		<p>
		His tone indicates that it's a question of how Maddie lives down here.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Ah. I'm Maddie. I don't really live in here so much as that I live right outside of here. I can't exactly be a part of society for... obvious reasons."
		<p>
		Maddie wiggles her ears and waves her tail, to emphasize them.
		<p>
		Maddie turns around back to where Vera is hiding.
		<p>
		"Vera get over here stop hiding! Pspspspsps!"
		<p>
		Vera feels oddly compelled to come over when Maddie makes that sound.
		</div><div class="wrap Reese_w"><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"Pleasure to meet you then, Maddie... My mom told me a while ago that cat people exist and that her friend knew some personally, but I assumed that was like a fairy tale or something."
		<p>
		Vera appears from the shroud of darkness, her good posture traded for a forward-leaning slouch for some reason. She crouches down beside Maddie. 
		<p>
		"I wish there were fairy tales sometimes... Is it possible that your mother's friend could assist me with a predicament I'm in? I need someone who knows a lot more about cat girls than we do. Please, Reese."
		<p>
		Reese seems a bit more uncomfortable now. He places his guitar down beside him slowly.
		<p>
		"Nice to meet you too Vera. Uh..."
		</div></div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Oh. Right. Yeah, this is Vera. She only recently got cursed with being a catgirl. She doesn't really like it and wants to figure out how to go back."
		<p>
		Maddie’s ears perk up as she gets a sudden idea.
		<p>
		"Oh! I could turn you into a catperson if you want! It's pretty fun, Vera's just kind of boring that way."
		<p>
		Maddie gives Reese a grin, showing her fangs, but no signs of hostility.
		</div><div class="wrap Reese_w"><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Shock flashes across Reese's face, and he covers his eyes with his hands for a few seconds.
		<p>
		“N-No thank you Maddie. Really, I'm really fine. I'm not bothered by my human features. As for Vera's 'predicament'... Maybe I could ask my mother or her friend. Maybe that could help. Not sure, to be honest, but it could be worth having a go?”
		<p>
		Vera nods quickly and easily, saying, “If anything comes of it, I promise we'll return the favor. Isn't that correct, Maddie?”
		</div></div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Yeah, I'm not going to bite you by the way. It would be kind of rude to bite someone as soon as you meet them. Asking for more help would be great, please do it if you can. "
		<p>
		Maddie tilts her head, thinking about Vera's proposition. 
		<p>
		"Not sure what kind of things you'd need a couple of catgirls to do for you, but sure. I'll suck your dick or something if you want I dunno. I'm pretty bored so I'll help out with pretty much whatever for the hell of it. I'll steal a car if you want."
		</div><div class="wrap Reese_w"><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera growls at Maddie for suggesting such a bizarre favor. And Reese grabs his stuff from the floor.
		<p>
		“There won't be any need to help me, Maddie and Vera, promise. It's sort of just exciting this happened at all! Thank you for making my night more interesting. Guess it's getting too late for me anyway, so I'm packing up, but it's been a treat, really. Oh, is there any other stuff you want me to bring when I come back next time? It wouldn't be any trouble, really.”
		<p>
		He stares back at Vera's eyes with a kind of sympathy. Vera sighs and stands up.
		<p>
		“A cellphone could be very useful, if you have an old one or find any other I can use, Reese.”
		</div></div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"One last thing, do you have like a laser pointer I can borrow? I know it's a bit of a bizarre request but I want to test something."
		<p>
		Maddie pats Vera on the head, ruffling the hair between her ears. 
		<p>
		"It's probably time we get going soon too. We can meet up back here. Please don't tell too many people catgirls are real. I don't mind being popular but it can get out of hand really fast."
		</div><div class="wrap Reese_w"><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"Uh, yeah, sure, I have a laser pointer right now actually," He says. "It's settled then. I'll be here again when I can. Listen for my tunes. Your secrets are safe here. Thanks."
		<p>
		He removes a miniature laser pointer from a keychain, passes it to Maddie, and then walks out into the darkness the other way. He strums his guitar with just his fingers some times.
		<p>
		Vera watches him leave for quite some time before recognizing that Maddie has made her all too comfortable in her physical presence, so she slips away and returns back to Maddie's home.
		<p>
		Inside, Vera groans at her image in a silver mirror with chipped corners. Her hair is everywhere and her uniform resembles a moderately used napkin. 
		<p>
		"I need to bathe and get new clothes. I look homeless. Mrr."
		</div></div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie walks back and catches Vera complaining about her clothes.
		<p>
		"Hm. I can go grab you some clean clothes if you want. It's not too much of a pain, the clothing store is nearby. It'll only take an hour or so. Do you have any preferences?"
		<p>
		Maddie walks up behind Vera and gently pets her tail, knowing Vera will enjoy it.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		A more relaxed sigh releases from her. She looks at the way Maddie touches her tail, and she then combs the hair from her face with her fingers. Her cat eyes are ever-startling. 
		<p>
		"Thank you for your offer, Maddie. I prefer white and blue semi-formal outfits similar to my uniform I'm wearing, if you can locate that. Would you like money?"
		<p>
		The only blue in her current outfit, though, is her crescent moon hair clip. She holds up her wallet again from her grimy sash, dangling it between two fingers.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Why would I need money to get clothes? Oh right... the whole ‘stop stealing’ thing you're trying to tell me. Don't be ridiculous, save your money. I can wash your clothes for you by the way, I have some soap and I can use the hose to fill a bucket. "
		<p>
		Maddie walks to the door, without taking the money.
		<p>
		"Alright, I'll be back from the store with what you want. Be back in an hour!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She stuffs her wallet away again, and she states a snide under her breath.
		<p>
		She then continues, "I was wondering about how you clean your things. Okay, sure, thank you for that offer too. I'll be here, working." 
		<p>
		She watches Maddie leave, and she then slowly pieces through the cat girl's private drawers. Vera's enhanced sense of hearing should make this safer. The harder part might be leaving everything as she originally found it when she is done, if Maddie is particular about her possessions.
		<p>
		Who cares about 'acting petty' anymore! If she can learn anything relevant, it's a step closer to ending this.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Vera, digging through the drawers, finds some bizarre things. She finds clothes, as expected, an unopened Lego set, at least 3 dildos, and a gaming PC, laid flat sideways to take up an entire drawer. She finds an old journal, with not much written in it. It's mostly full of doodles and random sketches, with not much of value. She does however kind of have the urge to draw in it, which is distracting her immensely from searching for a solution to her situation.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She places back away the majority of Maddie's possessions after they're all strewn about, taking extra care to grab the dildos with paper towels again from near the microwave. Then the only thing left is the journal. Vera would have to ask another day about the computer tower, perhaps.
		<p>
		She sighs, giving into the random compulsion by grabbing the Keerbo pen from her stack of papers and spending several minutes drawing a poor face of a woman with hair white with age. Well, white from the paper color. Vera had taken an elective in drawing once for her field research apprenticeship, but it was a weak subject of hers...
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Vera absentmindedly flips the page a couple of times, most of which are blank, until she reaches a rather shocking page. It's a decently drawn picture of a woman and a catgirl having sex. One of them clearly is Maddie, and the other doesn't look like anyone Vera has ever seen. The page after it has a more formal sketch of the woman from the drawing; however, this sketch has catlike features, similar to Maddie and now Vera.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera growls loudly, suddenly. She shuts the journal after seeing the better sketch of the strange woman while her heart races the clock. "Pervert."
		<p>
		She places the journal away inside of its original drawer and position, and she collapses onto her mattress and throws her pen at her papers. What if all cat girls are also sentenced to being... floozy? Vera clearly is losing her grip on some things with her usual self, so she should exercise real caution...
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		As Vera is lying there, she hears a noise at the door, and she sees a fairly shocked looking Maddie gazing at her.
		<p>
		"Why are you going through my stuff... What are you even hoping to find?"
		<p>
		Then Maddie sees the journal, and she blushes deeply. She then drops the clothing she was carrying and dashes over to grab the journal.
		<p>
		"You didn't find... that page... did you? Please tell me you didn't see it..."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera faces Maddie from her bed, and a soft meow escapes her.
		<p>
		"Maddie, I can explain—I really need to figure out anything I can before it's too late. I don't know when it'll be too late, but I know I keep changing, and I don't know if the curse will become permanent somehow... I'm fighting for my life, okay?"
		<p>
		Her light flush and her tail's motions say all that Maddie needs to know: Vera saw the page in the journal.
		<p>
		"Thank you again for the clothes. I couldn't have done that without you..."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"It's not like you're going to die or anything... I've been fine as a catgirl, you might end up being fine too. But I'll still help you fix this situation. I assume you found the sketch... of her. Actually, maybe she knows more. If only we could find her again... I miss her."
		<p>
		Maddie gently puts the journal down and then picks up the outfit.
		<p>
		"Oh right. You should get cleaned up first. Want me to hose you down? It's pretty much your only option."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera nods apologetically, unsure of what she can say to assure Maddie's feelings, and she heads for outside.
		<p>
		“Okay, well, what do you mean by 'hose me down'? Shouldn't there be a shower somewhere I can use, hopefully? I imagine you have soap and a towel as well... There actually is no shower, is there? But I can't just rinse off with you looking at me. That's not okay.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Oh come on. I can cover my eyes if you want. You just need to get cleaned. I will not allow you to be filthy in my house. It's improper."
		<p>
		Maddie smirks at Vera, knowing full well that her 'house' is a mess. She takes Vera by her hand, pulls her to the door, and takes her outside.
		<p>
		"You need to get cleaned. Now."
		<p>
		Vera, rather than protesting as a person who doesn't want to be hosed down, feels opposed to it more in the way of a cat that really doesn't want to be bathed.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		"This is so embarrassing. I'm not really some housecat. I always shower in a bathroom. Please cover your eyes. And, okay, stop making fun of me—"
		<p>
		Vera struggles against Maddie's hand, her panicked desire to escape her and the hose seizing away all of her reasoning to bathe in the first place. It's even more embarrassing!
		<p>
		So she growls and mrows, then, but she has a hard time getting farther away than even Maddie's reach still. But she's still fully clothed, she wouldn't just spray her...
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Alright Vera. You have 30 seconds to strip down before I just start blasting you with the hose fully clothed."
		<p>
		Maddie pulls a bottle of shampoo from near the hose and tosses it to Vera. 
		<p>
		"Come on, it's not that big of a deal. You need to get clean."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera catches her breath, shakes her head, and then stares at the end of the hose with a heavy reluctance.
		<p>
		"Cover your eyes and shut up."
		<p>
		She starts undressing afterwards, then, leaving nothing but her panties and her bra on. Even her hair clip is set aside on the dirty pile. Her cheeks are very red. She's primed to just lunge at Maddie with her recently sharpened nails at any defiance, at any perverted peek at all.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie, without uncovering her eyes, turns on the hose, spraying it at Vera. It's cold, and the sudden impact of the freezing water surprises Vera, her tail sticking straight out.
		<p>
		"Okay, just tell me what direction you need me to move it in. Like this."
		<p>
		Maddie angles the hose up, spraying Vera in the face for a moment.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		A sharp, frustrated yelp escapes Vera. She then purrs angrily. She opens up the fabric of her undergarments with her hands so that she can rinse out those areas as well briefly, and she grabs the bottle of shampoo by her feet. She tilts her head into the stream of water, unamused by the face spray. Then, she scrubs in the shampoo. All this cold water is going to give her the flu. 
		<p>
		"Don't move," She yells.
		<p>
		She moves on to washing her petite figure with soap soon while the water creeps down from her head and to her shoulders. They have two large scars, one on each shoulder, which she would prefer to ignore.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie continues holding the hose, not peeking at all. She waits for Vera's call to stop, patiently.
		<p>
		"Stop taking so long, I want to shower too you know! Oh also do you want me to grab you a towel when you're done? No one likes a wet cat."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera almost forgets to wash her tail, but she does wash it, shivering. She meows pathetically.
		<p>
		"Okay. I'm done. Get me a towel. Don't look at me. Do you have tea bags? I could use hot tea..."
		<p>
		She stares at her dripping mass of hair on her head in the reflection of the subway train glass.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Yeah, I can probably find some tea somewhere in the room."
		<p>
		Maddie disappears inside, emerging a moment later. 
		<p>
		"Think fast, soggycat!" 
		<p>
		Maddie throws the towel at Vera, and it lands on her head.
		<p>
		"I'm going to start the tea now, come inside when you're dry."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera takes the towel and scrubs her head and figure and hides herself from view of the windows, wandering around outside for some time. When she returns to Maddie's home, she's dried, wrapped in the towel, and standing in the doorframe. She's made an attempt to cover her shoulder scars, but they're still partially visible. She's still red.
		<p>
		"Could you pass me my new clothes?"
		<p>
		She sneezes.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie passes Vera the clothes. She then turns back to the table, where two mugs are full of water. 
		<p>
		"I'm going to go warm up the tea, I'll be right back."
		<p>
		Maddie heads outside to the grill, placing the mugs on it to start heating up the water.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera frowns at the clothes Maddie selected for her. She honestly believed that Maddie had bought these for herself and that her new outfit would be something else she brought.
		<p>
		But, with resignation, Vera places on the pink t-shirt, pale blue jeans, and hoodie. She doesn't really understand what the colon followed by a three is supposed to signify on the hoodie's design. The clothes are all too baggy.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Somehow, Maddie returns holding mugs that are not completely ruined by the grill, each filled with hot water. As she walks in, she sets them down on the table and then notices Vera wearing the new clothes.
		<p>
		"Oh my god. You are absolutely adorable wearing that. You're so soft and cute!!!"
		<p>
		Maddie rushes over to Vera without further hesitation and hugs her, her tail waving back and forth. After a moment, she awkwardly breaks the hug.
		<p>
		"Oh... sorry. You are just so cute I couldn't resist it. The tea mugs are ready, I laid out some teabags on the table. Pick whichever you want."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera's late attitude takes in a dagger of serotonin by Maddie's compliments and hug. So, she does no less than an assuring smile and perking cat ears in return. She then gently leads away from the hug and shrugs as if only now just remembering who she presents herself as.
		<p>
		"It's okay. I suppose I've been struck by instincts too lately. But let's move on, Maddie, please."
		<p>
		She picks out the tea bag of green tea from the humble stash and plops it into her mug. She then sits at a chair and folds her legs, blowing on the surface of the liquid.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie takes her own cup, adding a bag of fruit tea and a copious amount of sugar. She sits down across from Vera, cradling the warm cup in her hands.
		<p>
		"I'm happy to see how much more comfortable you are being cute, Vera. It feels like you can really be yourself more!"
		<p>
		Maddie laps up a sip of her tea, enjoying the sweet beverage.
		<p>
		"Anyways, we should get some rest soon. We need to get ready for tomorrow when we're going to figure out how to get you some help. Anything else you wanted to do before bed?"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“I'm not sure that's being myself, Maddie. I'm normally modest about my appearance, and I believe for good reason.” Still, she smirks at the repeated mention of 'cute'.
		<p>
		Vera likes the noise of the sugar pouring in Maddie's drink. So, Vera reaches for the small bag and pours a smaller quantity into her own drink too. Shouldn't hurt.
		<p>
		“Sure, Maddie. I am getting tired, so I agree. Quick question, though: are you going to wash my old dirty clothes later?”
		<p>
		Vera isn't really sure what Maddie has in mind for figuring out how to help her, however. She laps some of her tea with her tongue as if it were a bowl of water before correcting herself to sip it formally.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie waits for Vera to finish her tea and then pulls out a small object.
		<p>
		"Here's something that'll 'help' you for a bit."
		<p>
		She points the object at the wall near Vera, and a red dot appears on the wall. Instinctively, Vera feels the urge to try and grab or pounce at the dot, for seemingly no reason.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera groans. Her eyes flicker around the room, following the trail of the red dot. She stands up and follows it slowly, restraining herself. She has to find the right opportunity to grab it. Although—
		<p>
		“Maddie, why is this helping me at all? Stop playing with my head like that. Even if you keep it up, this dot won't escape my clutches, anyway.”
		<p>
		She purrs and crouches close to the current wall with the dot.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie points the light towards the ceiling, giggling as Vera slowly follows it with her gaze, wound up like a spring, ready to pounce at it. 
		<p>
		"You'll definitely get the dot! You got this Vera!"
		<p>
		She shines the light to the other end of the train carriage, watching Vera sprint and pounce for it, barely stopping herself from slamming into the wall.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera purrs unhappily, bested by the red dot and this little game. Her attention for it slowly fades, but not without great effort. She does something of a little pout beside Maddie.
		<p>
		"I'm definitely going insane... Regardless, I've been thinking about it, Maddie, and I wanted to say I'm sorry about—looking at your stuff earlier. I'm sure that wasn't the right thing to do. Mrow."
		<p>
		Her tail extends to Maddie's side.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Oh, it's fine. I don't really care much anymore. It's probably for the better, maybe there's something that could help us. Maybe I could find her again..."
		<p>
		Maddie begins preparing some bagels with cheese on them for dinner, humming as she works.
		<p>
		"Wanna cuddle to sleep tonight? I promise you'll sleep better, the cardboard box is super cozy! Tomorrow will be important towards getting you back, you should try to get the best rest possible!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She watches Maddie preparing the meal. She tilts her head, and she wanders to the cardboard box, sitting inside it, not quite curling up.
		<p>
		"It's strange that not sleeping on the mattress is even an option. But I suppose... I like this box. I don't understand why. Cats are silly."
		<p>
		She shrugs. She joins Maddie at the table when the bagels are done, and eats slowly.
		<p>
		"So, okay, I'll join you in the cardboard box, but please no cuddling. I'm not like that. I don't sleep with people. This is all really a transgression of myself, honestly."
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie continues to eat, enjoying the taste and, for once, actually enjoying Vera's presence.
		<p>
		"You know, it's nice hanging out with you. I know you probably don't like this, but, now that I've gotten to know you, it's been fun. I hope you don't still hate me once this is all over.
		<p>
		She finishes one half of her bagel, waiting before eating the second piece.
		<p>
		"But anyways, tomorrow is important. Anything you want me to grab before we head out tomorrow, or do you think we're good to go?"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera's ears perk, but she looks away shyly.
		<p>
		“Thank you, Maddie. I admittedly have a better sense of your perspective now, so I can understand why you might have been so compelled to—bite me. Yeah. However, I can't guarantee that when I return to normal I'll still understand. So, I guess having fun now isn't such a bad thing? Or am I just justifying...”
		<p>
		Her voice trails off. She bites her lip.
		<p>
		“We should grab water bottles and a coffee by tomorrow morning. Could be a cold brew. Where are we going to go?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"I'm... not actually sure. I was thinking we could go through the outskirts of the city. Maybe we'll find someone who knows more about this. I really don't know, but I don't know if that woman has left the city. Maybe she's still around, she could be very helpful in figuring out what to do."
		<p>
		Maddie walks towards the door, an empty bag slung over her shoulder.
		<p>
		"I'm going to grab some more water and some coffee. I'll be back in a little while, why don't you get ready for bed while I'm gone?
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“It's a good idea,” She says. “Maybe anyone else who's been cursed like you and I lives there.”
		<p>
		She grabs the stack of papers and the pen from the side of the mattress and then returns to Maddie's cardboard box, properly settling inside of it this time. She curls up in a way she's unsure her anatomy could have allowed for before this assignment. Her hoodie is thrown over her still damp hair.
		<p>
		“Goodnight, then. Maybe we will find this woman, Maddie. I can kind of tell you worry about her.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Vera is unable to rest well, struggling to finally fall asleep. A couple hours later, she feels something warm curl up against her, joining her in the box. However, she feels as if nothing is off and this time falls asleep quickly, enjoying the company.
		<p>
		-----------------
		<br>
		She wakes up to find Maddie curled up next to her, still sleeping, in a way that Vera finds extremely adorable. Sunlight is pouring through the scratched windows of the train car as they've slept late into the morning.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera doesn't intend to wake Maddie up prematurely, as unexpectedly pleased with the cute, physical company as she is. So, Vera reaches for the stack of papers beside them, intending to write some more notes down before she probably loses interest and doodles or something. Bloody curse.
		<p>
		She discovers immediately that she can't read what she wrote last time, however. It's clearly language, but it might as well be Indonesian. She yelps and kicks Maddie on her leg once, waking her up after all.
		<p>
		“Maddie, we need to get out of here immediately. I can't—read anymore!?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie awakens abruptly, jumping straight up out of the box, her tail completely straight in surprise.
		<p>
		"AAAA! What happened? Are you okay? Why did you kick me?!"
		<p>
		Maddie shouts out a string of questions, clearly alarmed by the sudden awakening. Then, she calms down after a moment.
		<p>
		"You can't just smack me to wake me up like that. It's really rude! And what's this about reading? If you're asking me to read, I can't do that! I don't know how to do that. Do it yourself or something!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She throws the papers in the air between the box and Maddie, and so the pages fly with different velocities and then scatter the carpet.
		<p>
		“Allow me clarify. Your curse has made me unlearn how to read, Maddie.” She growls. “So, all these notes are gibberish to me now, too. We're going, now.”
		<p>
		She shakes her head, stands from the box, and then she scurries out the door. She throws the hoodie over her ears, and she stares back into the train-car, expectant.
		<p>
		“I feel so stupid. Just take me to the outskirts you talked about yesterday.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie follows her out the door, hastily getting dressed the way she has.
		<p>
		"We can get to the outskirts through back allies and stuff. It's like a half hour walk."
		<p>
		She walks over to a hole in the wall, going through it and climbing over a rusty chain fence. 
		<p>
		"C'mon, it's this way!"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera stops at the chain fence, studies the dim scene, and then climbs the fence after all. She approaches Maddie's side, and she keeps her chin low.
		<p>
		“I have—mixed opinions about last night. I can't believe how easily I slept after you joined me in the cardboard box. It's like I was cold and lonely.” She almost chuckles. “Is that a sensation you feel sometimes, sleeping there?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Yes. Quite often, actually. I don't really get to hang out with anyone other than the occasional local kid. It gets pretty lonely."
		<p>
		Maddie walks behind an old bookstore, through an alleyway. This part of the city is mostly old buildings, few reaching more than a few floors tall. 
		<p>
		"This part of town is quite nice. I like just hanging out on a rooftop here. Not as loud and busy as everywhere else. We should keep going, though. Maybe we'll find something helpful soon."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Sorry,” She says. “It's possible I understand now. Furthermore, I quite dislike children.”
		<p>
		The noise even here is everywhere to her sensitive ears, but it really is much less. Maddie's behaviors are really all starting to make sense, even the casual insistence to climb a building to its roof. Even her erratic nature.
		<p>
		She swallows, and she continues her confession. “I'm bored. I almost would rather be sleeping. That's kind of scary, isn’t it?”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"Wasn't the whole point of this to find you some help? Why are you trying to nap? I like myself a nap sometimes but definitely not now. Let's keep moving, there has to be someone or something that can help us!"
		<p>
		Maddie continues to lead Vera down alleyways and quiet streets until she reaches an old abandoned power plant next to a canal.
		<p>
		"Hey, if we're looking for other cat people, maybe that's a good spot. Abandoned buildings are easy to move into, as you saw with my home."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Okay, yeah, you're right. Maybe cat people will be in that run-down place. It's possible.”
		<p>
		She sounds less than confident, anyway. She grabs an empty styrofoam cup from a dirty table and tosses it back and forth between her hands with rather good reflexes. She then tosses it at Maddie. “Catch.”
		<p>
		She sticks her tongue out slightly.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		The cup misses completely, but Maddie is unfazed and immediately pounces after it with surprisingly agility. She grabs it and then tumbles while clutching onto it. She then brings it back to Vera, smiling. 
		<p>
		"Okay, back to what we were doing please. You're cute but I want to get this situation fixed."
		<p>
		Maddie climbs over the fence and then walks over to the boarded up entrance of the power plant. One of the windows of the building, however, is conspicuously not boarded up. Maddie spots this window and climbs up to it, which is about 20 feet off the ground. She climbs through it, tumbling onto a metal catwalk below it. She moves to the window and then looks down at Vera.
		<p>
		"Come on up, let's look around. You can climb up here easily, right?"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She smirks, too, bearing her fangs. “Well, thank you. Okay, sure, we're getting me back to normal, right.”
		<p>
		Vera climbs over this next fence without so much as stopping, and she then runs a nail on the rough material of the sheer wall. She tilts her head back and forth, and her tail waves behind her.
		<p>
		“I can totally do it this time, but can you come back down first? You know, in case I fall down so you can catch me? I believe they say 'safety first'!”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie rolls her eyes and then without warning jumps out the third floor window, landing on her feet seemingly unharmed.
		<p>
		"Okay weak little kitty who can't climb on her own. Go ahead. I'll definitely catch you if you fall."
		<p>
		Maddie gives Vera a grin, waiting for her to begin climbing.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera screams. The harmless landing, though, leads her to stop and fold her arms. She then emphasizes a growl and starts scaling the wall as if it were rock climbing with many thin, unintended handholds and footholds. It's almost as natural of a 'sense' as the night vision.
		<p>
		“I'm not a 'weak little kitty'. I'd like to remind you that I'm essentially an agent. This curse complements my training while I have it. Where's your training?”
		<p>
		She passes through the window frame, and she continues, “At the bare minimum, you could have told me I can land on my two feet like a real cat can land on four unharmed.”
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		"The two feet thing actually took a lot of practice. I landed on all fours for years, but finally managed to start doing it on two. And my training was successfully shoplifting for years without getting caught and shipped to a lab or something."
		<p>
		Maddie gracefully climbs back up the wall, much faster than Vera did. She stands next to her and surveys the interior. There are multiple turbines, which would have spun using a water wheel in the canal when the power plant was in use. There's also a metal door on the opposite side of the building leading into what is labeled as a control room. Scratched and fogged up windows make it difficult to see into the control room, however.
		<p>
		"Let's go check the control room. Maybe someone's in there or we'll find something cool and breakable. I'm kinda bored."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Speaking of laboratories, my society has a state-of-the-art facility that would probably love to conduct some trials on you,” She says. She puts her hands on her hips, already walking to the control room.
		<p>
		“We won't hurt you, and we can reimburse you. You should consider it. Except... We are trying to cure me soon, in case this is like a time-limited cure or something, of course. It would have to wait, if you volunteered. Anyway, I'm bored too. I even instructed you that this was boring earlier. Told you so. First breakable thing is mine.”
		<p>
		They make it to the door, and she struggles with the metal handle. It's heavy and locked. She meows and steps aside.
		</div><div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w"><p>
		Maddie rattles the lock a bit, and then her ears perk up as she has an idea. She pulls out a set of lock picking tools and then begins to work on the lock. Her tongue pokes out slightly as she's concentrating, poking expertly inside the lock. A few minutes later, it clicks open, and Maddie gives Vera an over-the-top bow.
		<p>
		"After you. You're welcome."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Do you always have a lock picking set with you?”
		<p>
		She shakes her head, her ears suggesting she's still rather amused, and pulls the handle again. Then, a cat with black fur immediately darts out of the room. So, Vera glances at Maddie with hope, drags her into the room with her, and closes the door behind them.
		<p>
		It's a large control room. Countless levers and buttons are deactivated, judging by the sea of scruffy cats squirming all across the panels. And a tall woman with cat ears and an especially large and fluffy tail turns around to face Maddie and Vera from her office chair beside a desk with a yellowing computer.
		</div><div class="wrap Caroline_w"><p>
		"Oh my goodness you let Johnifer escape. Wait... how did you even get in here? I thought the door was locked."
		<p>
		She adjusts her circular glasses, looking at the two women who entered. 
		<p>
		"Hold on. You two have the curse too! Is that why you're here? I'm doing important research right now, you know."
		<p>
		One of the cats climbs up onto the keyboard where she was working and she shouts a name, picking up the cat and setting it down on the floor.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera nods. She scurries to the monitor the stranger is working at only to be reminded that she can't make any sense of the text, and she leans on some nearby equipment.
		<p>
		"Yes. We're here to cure me of the curse. Will you be able to help me? What's your name? Please, I really can't go on like this. I'm worried I'll be stuck like this forever. Mrow..."
		</div><div class="wrap Caroline_w"><p>
		"My name is Caroline. I got bitten by one of these cats—" She glares at one of the cats in particular. "—and got this affliction a few years ago. Much like you two have. I've been researching it and looking for a cure. What are your names? I could use some help, and it'll be mutually beneficial if you want to be cured as well."
		<p>
		She turns back to her computer, looking through some files.
		<p>
		"I think I'm close to getting it, but I'm not certain. I think I'm still missing something; my prototype cures seem to purge the mind for a few minutes, but it reverts quickly after, and the physical changes won't go away."
		</div>
