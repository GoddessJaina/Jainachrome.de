	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			The twin bells of the town's central tower ring in near-unison, and the wisps spray out from the windows
			below, and the clouds above are moody. Azriel Cromwell isnâ€™t mayor, or the grand archmage, but all her
			training, surely, meant it is a matter of more years of meditative refinement of the auracraft for her to go
			from renowned instructor to legend.
		<p>
			She, though, needs to accompany this with a pretty shilling. And finally an offer that'd almost certainly
			shower her with fortune is at her hand. Miss Cromwell knocks the door of the manor, expecting the pompous
			and historically damning Whitmore family to all answer. She summons a wisp to brighten her caked face.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			After some small delay, the door slowly creaks open, and in its frame stands an equally aged woman adorned a
			quite fine butler's outfit. The visitor is eyed up and down, some degree of respect written into the else
			quite expressionless face.
		<p>
			"Ah, Miss Cromwell, as expected. Please, follow me inside. The Whitmores are already in their office." She
			turns, leaning the way up the central staircase across from the entry hall, and then in a door just down the
			hall. As expected, a pair of people clearly marked as parents of a more than generously difficult child are
			seated at a table with a seat free opposite them. The father, greyed hair and scruffy voice, motions her to
			sit.
		<p>
			"Welcome, Instructor Cromwell. I'm glad you could find the time for us. I hope the way here found you well."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			Instructor Cromwell leaves a polite and hasty nod for the butler woman, and then she says to Mr. Whitmore,
			"Thank you. I'd be pleased to discuss the terms of agreement." She sits in the free, opposing chair. And she
			folds her hands in her lap. The wisp highlighting her expression fades. "Your daughter's future is of my
			interest just as much as your own. And for that I request very favorable conditions. I'll elaborate if
			needed, only, however. What would you like to elaborate on concerning... Lucina?" She clears her throat. The
			girl's name is Lucina. "Perhaps more importantly, what would be useful to know?"
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The mother chimes in, with a very vague plea in her tone. "Concerning is the right word, yes. She has... A
			habit of being quite stuck up in her talents. A formal in-class education was unsuccessful, and we have
			already seen a few tutors come and go. She will test your Instructor's prowess even more than your magical
			prowess, and that despite her being eerily talented in the arcane arts of light, as you should be informed
			of already. You're free to take notes of them for your own magical studies. We can give you generous pay and
			arrange for most material needs that this challenge might require; all we ask for is that you manage to set
			her on the proper path of education and control. She is as much a hazard as a talent in her unrefined
			state."
		<p>
			The husband continues. "We are unfortunately very busy people, and you'll largely be left to your own reins
			during the tutoring. We only care for general progress and for Lucina to remain a happy and optimistic
			child, we have no hard expectations of a set curriculum or classical educational methods as those haven't
			proved fruitful at all. Do what you deem appropriate, as long as it works and does her well. There will
			always be house staff present in case of any immediate needs, you'll be allowed to call on them for
			assistance of any reasonable means."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			Instructor Cromwell nods, keeping a mental catalog on the list of expectations. She's been hired for her
			success stories, and she understood failing this prodigy and these sorry parents would not only mean failing
			all the pay, time, resources, and private rooms lent to her, but failing her exploding reputation as an
			instructor. And the girl's intrinsic affinity for light aura-wielding is something that could be, well,
			legendary too. For her and Miss Cromwell. She says, "You meet rowdy candidates in the studious realm of the
			arcane, and soon enough they're cut of their rose thorns. I'm sure Lucina and I can come to an agreement
			that progressing her abilities is simply more desirable for every sorcerer here, her included... I'll be
			firm, though. There is time for dinner, there is time for her laughter, there is time for her study and
			practice." She's been of immaculate posture this whole time. Only now she leans forward. "With the generous
			resources, pay, and the manor at large, the study and practice in particular should be totally, utterly
			meditative."
		<p>
			Her earrings bounce once. "When should I be introduced to Lucina? Will I have a guest room for my late
			evenings and quiet afternoon in this otherwise lengthy 1-on-1 tutoring series?"
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The instructor's knowledgeable words and experienced optimism manages to spark visible hope in both the
			Whitmores. "I am certain that we finally picked the right person for the task, surely. It isn't a secret to
			any of us here, of course, that leading her on a path of skill and not just talent could spell an astounding
			future for her." The lady sighs, and nods at the comment of wealth and resources. "We're aware that the
			money is likely a great part of the draw and motivation here and will supply as demanded, but do also keep
			in mind the more abstract value of all this. She could become a shining star in many respects, and you'll
			surely be a part of her legacy if you do well. And, well... The Whitmore legacy would do with the lift as
			well. It'd be a favor to all of us- Lucy! You should come say hi."
		<p>
			There's no response, just some rustling at the door. By the time Miss Cromwell has a chance to turn around,
			only a brief look of the young lady's face past the doorframe as she peeks in on the conversation is offered
			before she scurries down the hall again.
		<p>
			"...We'll arrange for you to meet soon enough, I suppose. She knows you're an instructor so she might be
			disapproving of your presence at first.", the scruffy voice tones again. "We can provide a guest room
			between all weekdays; for the weekends we cannot guarantee this and I do suspect you wouldn't want to stay
			here on a permanent basis anyhow. Rumor has it you're a very busy woman."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			Instructor Cromwell smirks at shadow of the nimble soon-to-be student. "Yes, I'll meet her in proper then.
			Anyway, I'm overjoyed to take weekdays here and weekends to outside endeavors. I'll be an inevitable
			presence in her day, so I'll insist to Lucina that she finds peace to my company." She sits back in her seat
			once more, and she's taller than minutes ago. She rests clenches her dominant hand against the edge of the
			table. "I've thought on legacy plenty, your daughter being no exception. I'm very pleased you're elated
			about what it'll mean for the Whitmores. I suspect it'll pave the way in my future. We all could follow if
			she studies the arcane light further than anyone before."
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The husband simply nods along sagely; it'd be wonderful to get that far, but even just progressing Lucy
			along somewhat would be great to start. "Very well. I don't think there's much reason to delay, so you can
			come by already tomorrow and we'll introduce you. Feel free to already take some belonging you'd want here
			along with you." He gets up, as if he's eager to end the conversation before Azriel has a chance to
			reconsider. "Thank you, so very much."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			"Thank you, likewise, for this once in a lifetime opportunity, Mr. Whitmore. I won't be needing anything
			stolen out of the home; however, I appreciate it." She stands up after speaking, and she checks her mental
			catalog if she's covered the necessary bases to the parents. And it seems so. She takes to offering him a
			handshake, and one for the mother as well. And she exits the home with shrouding her appearance in a veil of
			darkness, reserving her appearance from a collection of just-passing families just outside the manor. She's
			even worked with one of them.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Lucina_w">
		<p>
			--------------------
		<p>
			It's the day after, and Lucina is sat in waiting in one of the meeting rooms with her legs tucked onto her
			chair and a hot tea in hand. Her mother would have complained that she ought to sit properly, but even just
			getting her to be present and presentable for a tutor is a success in its own right so trying to improve on
			that is unnecessary risk. Little Miss Lucy had been a bit more willing than the last two times to attend,
			but still made some fuss in the process. Her mind wanders in her half-hearted patience, and she doesn't
			react to the sound of someone sounding at the door.
		<p>
			She feels a slight bit different about Cromwell than the last few tutors even just from the small bit of
			observation she caught the day before, but she can't quite find out why.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			Instructor Cromwell walks into the room and closes the door behind her without ever moving a finger. She
			similarly sits in a chair which slides a bit forward after just across from Lucina. Perhaps Lucina just
			needed someone to show a generous usage of magic to spice the mundane. It sometimes does the trick, anyway.
			She's wearing a lovely purple set, and her dark hair has been done up in a casual, messy bun.
		<p>
			She smiles at Lucina. And she says, without compromising her adult air, "Hello. I really look forward to
			working together with you, Miss Lucina, but today I'd like us to get to know one another. And let's keep it
			relaxed. Do you happen to already know my surname?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Lucina_w">
		<p>
			Lucina watches the display with measured amounts of interest, tucking her legs in just a little more and
			taking a few sips of her drink. "Mom and Dad have hyped you up a fair bit, Miss Cromwell, but they've kind
			of done that every time there's been a new instructor. It's always the same really. Did they tell you,
			you're the seventh in line?" Her eyes, however, stick on Azriel more than they've usually done on the
			instructors. Is it really always the same? Who knows. Lucina is ready to be impressed.
		<p>
			Lucina, today, is clad in fairly modest but comfortable housewear attire, though due to her family's
			standards it's more than fancy enough to count as a presentable. Again, having her actually attend this
			meeting was more a priority.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			"Ah, wonderful. I do have a most prestigious list of private tutoring successes, so I can't blame their
			excitement. I insist this won't be the same, however. Seven is an excellent number. It's the amount of
			schools of arcane arts, after all." She watches Lucina sip from her drink, and she puts her hands up on the
			table. Her manicured thumbs toying with one another. "How do you spend your time, Lucina? Something of an
			obsession with magic twiddling, or do you find yourself dabbling in other interests and affairs?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Lucina_w">
		<p>
			Lucina can't help but chuckle. With the amount of fresh starts to education she's had, she's been through
			the very generic details of magic so, so many times. "Yeah, yeah, schools of magic. Cryo. Pyro. Geo. Aether.
			Mortis. Vitae... Lumes. I know." The fancy nails do catch her attention as well, though. "I like dabbling in
			my talents but dad always complains that I'm making a mess or being reckless or such. So I keep it somewhat
			limited. I do also like reading, and I practice Arcanum quite a bit. Y'know, the board game. Dad says I'm
			really good at it! If the whole magic thing falls through due to a lack of instructors I could make my name
			playing that competitively instead." She puts her legs down and pulls the chair close enough to the table
			that she can put her cup down before tucking in her legs up again.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			Instructor Cromwell tilts her head and says, "Yeah, I figured you know. My point was just the cardinality of
			your amount of instructors now matches the cardinality of the schools." She nods somewhat, and she fidgets a
			bit in her chair at Lucina's mention of excelling at Arcanum. As it would have it, the magic thing won't
			fall through if she's the one teaching. At least, if it did, Instructor Cromwell could kiss her perfect
			reputation goodbye. She smiles. "Your excellence in the old game should prove valuable in the breed of
			clever strategies and complex conjurations found only in the arcane... So, the best instruction of inner
			talent will often involve 'messes' being made, especially when placing your first spells and, much later,
			your largest spells ever. I'll ensure we have space to work with."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Lucina_w">
		<p>
			"Beh. I can very well avoid a mess as much as make one." She turns her not entirely empty cup of tea upside
			down, but no spill is made. Judging from the slight glint of frosted humidity along the bottom of the cup,
			it's fair to assume the contents are frozen in place... And then, a small crunching noise, as the expanding
			liquid makes the ceramic most subtly crack under the pressure. Lucina eeps ever so gently, partially because
			she knows her parents will complain again if they find out and partially because she definitely botched her
			snarky presentation of magic.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			"We'll have time to impress me soon. I will say, though, you've managed to both not make a mess and make a
			mess at the same." Instructor Cromwell gestures some fingers at the ceramic cup, and she slides it outside
			Lucina's grasp. She continues, "When we begin proper lessons next time, and we have a comfortable space to
			practice the arcane, I encourage you to impress me. We'll work from there." She faces Lucina, and she leans
			forward against the table. "As hard as it might be to believe, although I come from a background of
			allegedly formal education, fine-tuning your use of the arcane arts often comes in many, less formal
			sittings. And even if you know the books on beginner's conjurations, the fine-tuning is always a bit of
			homework. And for us, thankfully quite the focus."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Lucina_w">
		<p>
			Lucina instinctively reaches after the cup as it escapes her, but realizes that she's not in charge of what
			happens to it any more. "Could... You fix it, somehow? I don't want dad to be annoyed again. ...Please?" Her
			ego has visibly taken as much a crack as the cup has, and she pouts cutely. A bit of a habit she has from
			trying to gain pity from the mansion staff in similar situations.
		<p>
			As Azriel leans in, however, something in Lucina's brain whirrs. Something about this woman's mannerisms is
			certainly different from what Lucy is used to. She has the air of a proper and fancy instructor but she is
			just not by the books.
		<p>
			Also, Lucy feels vaguely warm. She doesn't realize her cheeks reflect this ever so subtly. "Very well, Miss.
			I'll... See what I can do, then. Would you want to see the... Light, when we do? Everyone loses their mind
			over it, for some reason. I don't get it. Everyone tells me I'm unrefined and in need of learning when I can
			so clearly do things they can't."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			Instructor Cromwell smiles a thin smile at the pout, finding it difficult to pity from all her time with
			prior students whining and pouting. She finds the pouting from Lucina more, well, adorable. "I don't want to
			fix it, and I'll just inform your father the simple matter of what happened. It's merely peas to complain
			about compared to the exciting developments of the week ahead to be enchanted about. Indeed, we have later
			for parlor tricks, absolutely." She doesn't take much notice of the cheeks, even though Lucina is pale.
			Being flustered is quite normal. She taps her own chin, considering the impressive Lumes arcane art to be
			had. "Actually, Lucina, I think we'd do well to start with your ice magic. The work with light is very
			unusual, certainly, in how uncommon and relatively new it is to be wielded. And precisely because of that I
			think your work with the arcane school of Cryo will serve us better to start fine-tuning first. I specialize
			in Pyro, however Cryo is among my strongest schools."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Lucina_w">
		<p>
			Lucina reads this a clear challenge for her to behave and do well for the next time. Well played, Miss
			Cromwell, she has to concede. "Pyro... You wouldn't know how many times the parents have counted their
			blessings for that not being on my list of innate talents. So... No Light for now? That's. Odd. You're sure?
			Everyone usually wants to see it. But I'll take your lead. For now." She raises her hand and some snowflakes
			materialize in the air around it, slowly drifting down. It's a very minor amount, since she's well versed in
			how much effort it is to dry off a proper indoor snowfall. "So, when do we start? Do I need yet another
			edition of Visualizing Invocations? I have three of them already. They keep updating it, and my family
			doesn't hesitate to get the most up to date content."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azriel_w">
		<p>
			"I'm quite sure. My patience might measure favorably compared to your prior instructors from the sounds of
			it. I'm sure they enjoyed the early spectacle, however." She glances at the snowflakes, and she pushes back
			her chair slowly so as to stand up. "Tomorrow at the stroke of noon. We'll have lunch together with your
			parents about thirty minutes before that, so be ready for that as well... I think we've talked a good deal
			for now, and I've covered everything I wanted to know for now as your instructor. And, no, I won't be giving
			you another edition of that. Just reuse the latest edition for formal references when I might request any.
			Did you have any questions before I meet with your parents once more and then depart for my evening?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Lucina_w">
		<p>
			"Noon sounds... Late. Compared to what I'm used to." She smiles softly. "I like it. I think I don't have
			much else to mention right now, though? I'll have to see how things... Develop, first." Lucina gets up onto
			her feet ahead of Azriel, indicating that she's just as much in agreement about the meeting being over for
			now.
		<p>
			There's a small thud from inside the cup as the still frozen tea has thawed just enough to loosen from the
			ceramic and fall to the table.
