	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera chimes the door to Talia's sleeping quarters. She keeps her finger held down on the button, and she
			rubs
			her eyes
			and mouth with the back of her other hand. Her glasses are in her satchel. "Talia. I hope you're not a
			'heavy
			sleeper.'"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			The pink-red creature stirs slightly, and makes some slight noises of disapproval at being awoken. Not
			enough to
			be
			heard of course, so with a sleepy half-efforted call, she barely manages to convey through the door to Vera;
			"Awake!"
			This doesn't mean she manages to get out of bed though, where she stretches out her frame - twice, the first
			time being
			interrupted by pushing against bedframes on both sides. If Vera really needs to get inside soon, she surely
			would have
			the ability to, Talia supposes.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera leans her head on the door and says into it, "I need to just show you around today. I was going to
			anyway
			maybe
			later, but the other researchers of this place insisted I did now, and the Town AI. Guess word's gone around
			about the
			cosmic lady who slammed on the dome." She closes her eyes and reels back, and she then steps out of the way
			of
			another
			resident of these hallways coming through. Wasn't he a chef?


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			Talia slinks out of bed just long enough to crack the door for Vera and then returns to lying down with her
			feet
			planted
			on top of the bedpost. She's this time taken to strip off her fancy getup before sleeping, instead adorning
			some
			very
			comfy looking pajamas. She's finally fresh again too, having showered before rinsing the clothes in said
			shower
			and
			leaving the pieces in any accessible corner of the room to dry. "I have spare clothes, don't worry. I'm not
			planning to
			scout the village in pajamas or soggy outfit." Her hair is clearly in need of a brush and there's some
			dampness
			in bed
			from both hair and tail not being completely dry after washing; she's slept in the humid outsides plenty of
			times though
			so it doesn't bother her at all.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She nods and sits in the same chair as last night, and she sighs while staring at the clothes. "If you
			prefer,
			we could
			arrange taking your garments to the laundromat sometime and, for now, you could pile the used clothes in a
			basket. But
			no matter. I look forward to walking around with you, and just know that I'm going to need some coffee
			today. I
			still
			feel tired from last night. How, then, does our caliber of lunch buffet sound to you?" She glosses over how
			she
			still
			had goosebumps and difficulty sleeping with the racing possibilities of this possible celestial of Talia
			with
			such
			unique abilities of teleportation. How it felt to be ripped out into the sky. "Do... You ever trim all that
			hair?"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			The clothes seem to have no opinion of this suggestion, but Talia does stand up and pile them together
			fairly
			neatly as
			suggested. "Oh, that sounds like very good - I have a few sets of clothes I'd like to run through in that
			case.
			Sometimes I visit places that don't necessarily offer good opportunities to clean." She produces a hairbrush
			and
			gently
			sets to work on her hair.
		<p>
			"Ah, Buffets are always a curious thing since there's so many things and I don't always know what's meant to
			go
			together. Food can be so vastly different in places I visit - I'm by no means a picky eater though. But
			being
			given the
			chance to arrange a variety myself might lead to some peculiar combinations so I may need suggestions while
			we're
			there." A small yawn interrupts the brushing. "Oh, the hair? Yeah, it does get a bit of care on the rare
			occasions where
			it's practical to do so, but it's on and off quite fuzzy at times. If that's a service you offer though-"
			Her
			eyes run
			across the ends of her hair. "-maybe it could be in order."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Well, for as long as we work together, you can expect to share my usual luxuries for things like
			sanitation,
			food, and
			whatever other luxuries. I was thinking we'd maybe talk about this partnership in a bit more detail, maybe
			put
			it in
			writing; however, I'd like to reiterate, your willingness to help us here in Town is what separates you from
			an
			issue
			instead." Vera removes her glasses and tablet from her sash and starts to take note of today's information.
			She
			squints
			at the LCD. "Even if you were a picky eater, we'd have found something for you to eat. There's someone I
			know
			who gets
			on request ink squid pasta. But I could advise what I'd order together, sure—just, well, I wouldn't let that
			discourage your choices. Perhaps it would be interesting to see your selection without my bias, for
			instance."
			Perhaps
			her diet is influenced by her species, for instance, which is a coarse way to gain insight before a real
			genetic
			test...
			"We could do your hair later, sure. I'm sure the salon would be delighted to work on a tail."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			"You've already made your scientific stance on my peculiar ways clear, I know I'm a highly suspicious
			anomaly to
			your
			trained people. But that's okay, as long as you decide to be nice~" She bows, and giggles. Then, she begins
			to
			rummage
			several sets of clothes from her seemingly way too small pouch of magical capacity. Some variants and copies
			of
			her
			adventurer's outfit, a few more casual getups, one entirely clean that she intends to put on. "I promise
			I'll do
			what I
			can to be helpful and compensate for all this pampering and service... Oh, do maybe note that one or two of
			my
			clothes
			might be stained by things that don't react the way things do in this world. It shouldn't be a problem but I
			don't
			suggest just throwing them into a machine and leaving it unattended before testing it by hand in water."
		<p>
			She starts the motions of exchanging clothes before realizing that maybe, this place doesn't appreciate such
			things as
			casually. "If you rather not be here when I put other clothes on, I can scoot into the bathroom for a bit."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She rolls her eyes, and she then notes some of the contents coming from the pouch with increasing interest
			and
			shaking
			hands. "Wait, please, I don't understand... You have been helpful—you'll continue to be—but let's start with
			your
			little bag holding all that. What kind of magic is that? Are you just creating these clothes from your bag?
			What
			is the
			cost of creating these?" Vera leaves her chair, and she steps forward before covering her eyes and walking
			blindly away
			to the door. "No, I won't look. The bathroom would be ideal, yeah. Just, please, don't let that bag go
			anywhere,
			Talia.
			Take it with you to the dining commons, in other words. I have to know more."
		<p>
			Again, there's the notion of an 'otherwordly' potential to Talia's abilities. Vera asks, "I won't need a
			spacesuit,
			right? You always go somewhere I can breathe and exist? Where are you going that causes stains on your shirt
			to
			be
			radioactive or something?"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			"Nono, there's no exchange system or such going on. A thing that goes in is a thing that comes out. I can
			just
			keep a
			very large amount of things in there. There are no concerns to sorting, as long as I want a specific thing
			to
			come out,
			it is the thing I find in there. Else, it gives items back in roughly the order I put them in. And please,
			please don't
			mess with it or science on it. If it breaks, that could destroy souvenirs and memories of years of traveling
			and
			greatly
			set back my traveling abilities... Not to mention, the bag itself was a gift. I don't ever keep it out of my
			reach, and
			I will choose to leave this place if the option is handing over the bag for extensive research."
		<p>
			Talia sighs and gives a very stern gaze to Vera, realizes she's not looking and instead takes the pouch
			along
			with her
			clean change to the bathroom. Very swiftly, she's now adorned in a not overly cropped top of white and some
			pink-leaning
			pale pants. Definitely much subtler than her usual adornment; it makes her look almost plain despite the
			vivid
			hair and
			tail and ears. "I don't mean radioactive, just things that might fizz or become icky, and be unpleasant for
			a
			modern and
			sensitive machine. As I mentioned before, it would require a very targeted willpower for me to teleport to
			somewhere
			potentially inhospitable. Like the moon of this place. Never has my dimension hopping lead unexpectedly to
			an
			inherently
			harmful place."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera knows so many people in Town that'd take the opportunity for such a remarkable magical item being put
			under
			careful
			scrutiny. Still, a caveat is a caveat, and Vera needs to maintain her act as a new friend and not create
			some
			impression
			of a prison warden instead. She removes her hands from her sight with caution, scribbles details down on her
			device once
			more, and says, "Okay. So you have a storage container that somehow contains far more volume than the volume
			of
			said
			storage container, and you're asking me not to 'science' it... It's your request, and I'll honor that,
			Talia,
			however I
			still am curious what else I could learn about your bag and your history with it without taking it off of
			you.
			For
			instance, let's say you soaked the bag in a bucket of water. Would every possession inside the bag become
			wet
			despite
			the volume discrepancy? Or perhaps would the bag absorb all the water through the sides and many of the
			items
			wouldn't
			become wet? How many items are actually in there at the moment, anyway?"
		<p>
			Vera pops open the doorway to the room and walks backwards out to the hallway. She nods. "Oh, intriguing.
			You
			appear
			much less alien in that outfit. I appreciate the choice... Come along, Talia, I feel a headache coming on.
			Right, I do
			remember you mentioning that now. I'll make sure to let the people at the laundry know the special
			circumstances
			of your
			clothes, then, another time." As Vera and Talia walk down the halls, they enter a glossy white elevator.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, it's gotten soggy a few times. But it does mostly just accumulate the water that flows inside as a
			separately
			stored item. I could turn it upside down and pour out whatever liquids I want to no longer have inside it,
			probably. All
			other things generally keep to themselves in this stored state. Think of them like... Files in a computer,
			maybe. I saw
			you had these nifty folders when poking about and that's kinda what my bag does too. Considering I still
			remember the
			time I received the pouch and Annie- the previous owner cleared it out fully, I know most of the things in
			there
			still
			and it is, in fact, a large amount. There's probably some various bobs and ends and tools I've stashed in
			there
			haphazardly and forgotten about though. Maybe I'll need to consider entirely emptying it again sometime in
			the
			near-ish
			future just to take inventory and de-junk. In case it has capacity limits I'm not aware of."
		<p>
			Talia is realizing too that this endless loop of questions and answers will definitely go on for hours if
			allowed, and
			joins Vera with an eagerness and her pouch. Having taken a few elevators already in Town over the past days,
			she's
			fairly confident about it this time.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"From the sound of the way it stores even liquids, I'd say that is a surprisingly apt analogy. Truly your
			bag is
			a kind
			of perfect physical index of trinkets and substances. Every other bag—or sash—is quaint in comparison." Vera
			shakes
			her sash and its contents as the doors slide open, and she leads Talia and her through the white, wide,
			polished
			clearing directly outside the pill-shaped elevator. "I'd like to learn about this Annie and—if that's
			acceptable
			to
			your conditions Talia—I'd be pleased to be invited to the task of you examining your bag's whole inventory.
			You
			have
			an immensely safe bedroom to engage in such a task, after all." To their sides are at least a dozen small
			buildings, no
			taller than a few floors each, and many with strange architecture like triangular outer walls and decorative
			touches
			like green and blue strips of artificial light. Vera points out a stubbier example of one building, and then
			a
			taller,
			oval one. "That's the Immigration and Departures Office. That one is the library. It was especially useful
			when
			educating and training for this job position. Are you much for reading?"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			There's a slight lingering concern that some random objects in the pouch might simply be upsetting,
			chemically
			or
			practically or whatnot, for Vera and Town, so Talia simply appeases the suggestion with a bit of a shrug.
			Nothing that
			would explode when exposed to the air of this place, but... It's just a gut feeling, really. She covers with
			a
			slightly
			heightened but mostly genuine awe for the architecture of the surroundings. "I do read on occasion -
			There's, as
			fate
			has it, maybe a total of twelve different recurring scripts in the places I visit and I'm somewhat literate
			in
			most of
			them. I do on occasion come across places with entirely unfamiliar script or rarely even unfamiliar
			languages
			but it's
			never truly a barrier for whatever I am meant to experience. Don't think too deeply in that this means for
			the
			vastness
			of universes that aren't considered suitable for my fated travels. It hurts my head when I try."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera's eyes widen, and she drops her finger like a hot coal. "Twelve? You're contending for the world record
			at
			that.
			You'll have to take language tests for us sometime." She pauses for a moment. And they specifically head
			toward
			a path
			of shiny sidewalk over a constructed grassy hill. Passing by some more buildings. "You really might be
			ancient.
			No
			offense—the case would be either that or you're a child prodigy. And not to imply I haven't believed you.
			I'm
			just
			warming up to the evidence, which will hopefully be tested with your permission soon... Speaking of which,
			I'd
			like to
			see one of these universes you so claim. Our scientists and field researchers have uncovered possible means
			of
			teleportation explainable to magic or science, but dimensional leaps? You should talk to the Scientific
			Advancements
			Division sometime. Or simply take me." As they climb over the gentle slope, a columned pavilion with several
			seats
			adjacent to conveyer belts emerges. Food diagrams and posters are plastered anywhere beside closed doors.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			Talia feels quite flattered, though truly 'somewhat literate' is about the extent of some of these
			languages.
			It's
			sweet, in a way, to have Vera come around to her peculiar ways after the initial defiance, though practical
			demonstrations of course would make it hard to deny things.
		<p>
			"I would be up to offer some insights in whatever manner you're thinking. Assuming it's not like. Dangerous.
			We
			could
			take some more trips sometime! After last time you seem a bit more in the right mindset so maybe we can find
			some
			entirely new places and not the forests of your planet." She giggles. "Just be prepared that you rely on me,
			entirely. I
			think you could have gotten back from that place. If we're in a different branch of reality, you're truly
			fucked
			until I
			pull you back here."
		<p>
			Talia scans the visuals of food and such, a fascination spreading across her face. It's a bit of a necessity
			that she be
			intrigued by unknown cuisine after all, as she depends on it very frequently.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"None of those aforementioned tests would be harmful, no," She says. She sits in the first open booth they
			come
			across,
			and she returns the glances of the nearby lunch crowd from other seats. She presses her hand to a small
			monitor
			built
			into the wall perpendicular to Talia and her and scrolls through the listings. The food menu and other
			settings.
			The
			offers are diverse as promised. A normal restaurant would go out of business from spreading themselves too
			thin.
			"What
			meal appeals to you? And, you know, I'm starting to believe I really should be worried. I'd like not to be
			stranded in
			some universe I don't belong in. Maybe we should just take a probe with you instead... Then again, I perhaps
			do
			not
			really have a reason to distrust you so far. And, in fact, I'd have travelled universes with something only
			slightly
			less glamorous and reliable than a big machine." A young girl walks up to Talia's side and touches then tugs
			her
			tail.
			Her father runs up and grabs the young girl's waist, and he says, "Sorry. This is embarrassing."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			"What meal appeals to me? All of them, really. You can make a suggestion if you dare. Something good to
			represent your
			people~" Talia lets Vera handle her concerns about interdimensional travels in peace, and instead helps
			herself
			to some
			water. It's good quality hydration, of course, Town wouldn't have it any other way. The idea of going out
			alone
			with
			some technological gadget to accompany her seems silly; whatever readings it makes might be entirely
			incomprehensible
			and coming back with that would surely be a letdown for the team.
		<p>
			Before the intrusive girl can be yoinked away, she gets a playful whap of fuzzy tail in the face. "No
			worries. I
			know
			it's a majestic one." Still though, she lets it sit around her waist now instead of waving it about freely.
			Brushing it
			can be a bit of a chore so she'd rather not chance having an excessively feisty gremlin try to mess it up
			completely.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"...What I'm trying to get at, Ms. Starstrike, is that I think I'll take my chances in the name of going
			somewhere no
			man or woman has gone before. Just, please, stick close to me." She watches the father and young girl walk
			away,
			and
			then she taps the menu. Vera smirks. "You really are a game-changer. Even the chance is exciting beyond my
			wildest
			opportunities from before. Thank you, again, please. I'll help you to one of our best lunch platters, then,
			the
			'Full
			English.'" She confirms a second order as well. She presses a knuckle to her cheek and chin and her other
			hand
			she types
			into her personal tablet. "Twelve languages, good lord... We have a Visitor's Center I could show you today.
			It's rather
			a museum."
		<p>
			A stuffed omelette with spinach, a coffee, and the Full English arrives on two plates through the adjacent
			conveyor
			system after only a couple minutes. Town would say it has mastered quick and tasty meals, but the threshold
			for
			perfection runs a deep course in the culinary world. Vera takes the coffee and taps sugar into it from an
			included vial.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			"A Full English? What a peculiar name, but if it's one of your best I am excited. Just as much as for the
			other
			things
			you'd like to show me! This is quite a neat place overall, thank you for showing me around."
		<p>
			Talia allows Vera to take the foods off the conveyor belt as she doesn't want to accidentally snag someone
			else's meal
			in passing. This striking assortment of various meal ingredients spread on her plate achieves a curious head
			tilt, and
			the pink creature takes her fork to evaluate the various treats. "What an intriguing variety! I bet a lot of
			effort has
			gone into choosing what makes up the entire English." She samples the toast with beans. The sausage with the
			egg. The
			mushroom with the beans. The egg with toast. Most of the plate is consumed this way, in scientific pairwise
			exploration.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera nods, and she sips from her coffee. She hesitates after creating another cross section of her omelette,
			and
			she
			says, "I suppose it is nice to have a fresh, new member of Town. Of course, however; I wanted to—and it's my
			job
			anyway given the circumstances... Yeah, that meal's name has a strange etymology, doesn't it? I'm glad you
			like
			it.
			There's plenty more of that and any other meal you intend to feast on following that you stay here and we
			work
			together." She eats.
		<p>
			At one point, a passerby takes a picture of Talia on his phone. At another, a woman with a white lab coat
			and
			yellow
			nail polish asks Vera and Talia if she, Talia, is the 'magic visitor from space.' Vera says, "At least the
			sky.
			I'd
			request you please save the interviewing for me."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			Talia is occupied with food in her mouth, so she cannot respond much to the comment at the time. It does
			amuse
			her
			though, and once she's free to speak again she can't help but mention. "It seems I've accumulated a bit of
			fame
			here
			already. I guess these people aren't used to strange creatures falling onto their roof on occasion? I'll try
			not
			to let
			it get to my head, hehe." The platter of meal is finished in a very reasonable amount of time, and now she's
			just
			nipping idly at her drink of water as her tail has once again made itself independent and is swishing about.
		<p>
			"And I do look forward to more meals, what I've had so far has been good. Thank you. I am ready to leave
			whenever you
			are." She looks around, and meets more eyes than an average person would in this situation. Talia isn't a
			shy
			one
			though, and doesn't mind the attention.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			A bit of the omelette is left on her plate. "I gravitate to staying humble myself. I'd remorse being the
			celebrity. I'm
			even grateful my work contributes to the safety of my people without pinning me as one. A celebrity, that
			is."
			She
			slides the dirty dishes onto the conveyer belt, and Vera then stands up and says, "You're welcome, Talia.
			I'll
			lead you
			around the rest of the main circle and, afterward, any specific place you may find interesting before we
			head
			back. It's
			my only assignment today to tour Town with you and keep you company, so I hope that's fine." She glares at
			some
			of the
			passing faces of the diner, and she walks out ahead of Talia back to the sidewalk.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			Out of the depths of her satchel, Talia produces a paper towel and wipes her mouth off. She then trots after
			Vera, but
			does allow herself to give a brief smile and wave on a heel turn while her partner isn't looking. "If that's
			what you
			prefer, then I do suppose it's a good thing. I get my fair fill of solitude and unfamiliarity as you might
			expect, so it
			is very tempting to take what greater attention I am being offered."
		<p>
			Once they're on somewhat more open ground Talia stretches out impressively, her already somewhat trim top
			showing off a
			good bit of her tummy in the process. Her build is truly nothing too spectacular in any direction. A small
			bit
			lean, a
			small bit toned, minorly marked by her curiosity for foreign food being humored quite often. "How busy are
			you
			on a day
			to day basis, anyhow? It seems you're quite committed to the cause."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera shrugs. "I must admit that it makes sense in your context. Still, you would not wish to build on
			people's
			expectations and then fail to deliver. Town residents don't leave often, and therefore the past is never far
			from the
			memory of everyone around." She points her hand to a large white staircase leading up to a strangely
			cylindrical
			instalment on the edge of the grassy hill sidewalks in this area. Vera says, "That's the 'Visitor Center.'
			It's
			intended
			to be a museum, like an audio and physical medium to learn about the Town's founders and principles." They
			pass
			it and
			walk onto the sprawling white tile of the main town area once again, however. Some taller or wider buildings
			are
			in this
			area. One spirals most of the way to the dome. Vera says, "I am busy often. My job as a field researcher is
			what
			I enjoy
			doing most, so my mandatory vacation time is the least of my intrigue—speaking of which, we are in the
			entertainment
			sector. It hosts some of the conveniences I need, such as that clothing department and its laundromat, so I
			come
			here
			sometimes. That spire is the virtual reality pavilion."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Talia_w">
		<p>
			"Well, usually I don't put too much concern into maybe missing my mark, as one day I'll be gone forever
			anyhow... But I
			do suppose I'm some amount of stuck with these people for a longer time so I won't jeopardize it too soon!"
			The
			imposing
			architecture captivates the creature, and awkwardly almost trips over some stone border while looking up
			along
			the
			taller construction. "I'll be sure to check out the museum soon, then. Context seems good to have. For now,
			how
			about
			that trim of fur? I realize I really didn't have to leave my dirty clothes behind, but you really can be
			quite
			convincing... Virtual Reality? Curious! I would very much assume something with that name to be magical in
			nature but
			you really aren't the type to. So, what is it?" Talia's head is tilted in slight confusion as she observes
			the
			tower.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah, well, I'm here forever. If you betray someone's inflated expectations, I would hope that I am not
			caught
			in the
			crossfire." She starts walking to the left set of the buildings relative to where they came in from, the set
			closer to
			the center of the plateau Town resides on. "It is okay to worry about the dirty clothes later. We are
			approaching the
			hairstylist anyway, and she may be occupied with your tail... Oh, and the visitor center should be good
			later
			too, sure.
			As for virtual reality: I suppose you would call it a technological marvel. We have the most advanced and
			specific
			simulations anywhere in the world thanks to our leading team of computer scientists, team of neurologists,
			and
			our
			budget for it. Unfortunately, so much interest in making a fake interactive reality to enjoy is because Town
			majority
			wants to simulate danger or action in their peaceful everyday. There are more varieties of simulations as
			well."
			She
			leads Talia through the entrance of the hairstylist unceremoniously. The door slides closed behind them. The
			room is
			somewhat narrow; only about eight seats and mirrors are past the front desk. The attendant has a bright
			curled
			swab of
			green hair, and she smiles at the sight of Talia and waves at her. And Vera simply continues, "I only

			Talia mostly nods and hums along as Vera explains this technological marvel. She doesn't quite get it. "I...
			Supposed we
			can look at it sometime when we're not occupied. I'm sure it's neat once I get to figure it out!"
		<p>
			She slinks down into the first free chair, after a brief hesitation to see if the stylist disapproves of her
			actions.
			She makes sure the tail slinks nicely out the back of the chair. "Hi hello! I'm Talia. I've head you can
			offer a
			bit of
			freshening on the haircut department, and I'm quite in business for that. Mostly I need just a cleanup of
			the
			ends and
			the likes, it's been sooo long and you don't want to know what all it's been through. If you have some ideas
			for
			shaping
			it up though, feel free to take a bit more. But no more than... A third, unless you're a good negotiator."

			"It would be worth your time to investigate, I agree, whether you attend the pavilion for your entertainment
			or
			for a
			training simulation."
		<p>
			The hair stylist rubs her hands together with an almost devious energy, then, and whips a comb and thin
			scissors
			from
			the drawer in front of Talia. She tugs and fluffs the space creature's hair, and it dances between different
			pink
			silhouettes in the mirror.
		<p>
			"I know it dear, I can tell! I'll trim all these ends for you—I'll give you a style that you'll love, it'll
			accent you
			so much—unless you really wanted to look more regal or casual than wild? Because you look wild, girl. I've
			been
			looking
			forward to doing your hair the moment you landed on the roof! How do you feel about highlights?"
		<p>
			Vera shrugs and slumps into a chair within earshot. Alexandra always said Vera fashioned her hair 'too
			safely'.
