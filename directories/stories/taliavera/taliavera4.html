        Talia lays across her bed, face down and a leg up. What charming unkempt nature her hair used to have is now a
        finely shaped and smooth mane, tail equally flowing with a grace as it swishes. Alexandra had promised it
        wouldn't be too much upkeep to make sure it stays orderly, but was naturally eager to work with this amount of
        hair again in the future.

      <p>
        It has been a process, familiarizing herself with Town, its features, and her privileges as personal assistant
        to someone as high-tier as Vera. But it's been clear, the both of them have started itching to see some new
        places again. Through discussions on the matter, Talia is now confident that Vera knows what she's getting into.
        Hopefully Fate will see the same, and permit the duo a real adventure this time. She hopes so.
      </p>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        Town AI and the Scientific Research Department expressed with Vera one more time concerns of her new partnership
        with Ms. Starstrike. Town AI's predictive prowess would be rendered obsolete by the strangeness of Talia's
        abilities and circumstances, and the laboratory workers argued that Vera would catch a strange disease from a
        foreign world at bare minimum. But Vera had already set her mind on the incredible opportunity of becoming their
        first galactic traveler. And it would be a shame to disassemble Dr. Harrison's 'black box' rigged for measuring
        this surreal transportation, anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Documenting the world as Vera knows it up to this point has mostly been pinned to the finer details. On a new
        planet, even a broad overview of a culture would be extraordinarily new.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vera chimes Talia's doorbell multiple times and, when allowed inside, grabs the lady's arm. The field researcher
        is bubbly like a schoolgirl.

      <p>
        "We're finally doing this again! Okay, in the event that suggestion is actually polled, I please suggest that we
        travel somewhere a lot more interesting than last time."

      More soon.
