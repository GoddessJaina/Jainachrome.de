		<h1>Upperclass and Underworld</h1>
		<div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley Stirling sits in her apartment, surrounded by several newspapers and her laptop precariously balanced on one knee. It's the middle of a Friday workday, and they've still not done their personal quota for job contacts this week. Everything out on the market is so complete ass nowadays, truly. No one pays sufficiently, everyone has terrible conditions, and Ash has some standards despite being on a thinner and thinner budget every week. They throw a newspaper away, and it lands as an undignified pile of sheets. Some of these jobs read like one is meant to sell their soul for a pittance. 
		<p>
		Sigh. She sips from a by now only mildly toasty hot chocolate. It's still more than good enough to them—she's used to making do with leftovers and such. And then, when Ash is about to give up and go have a displeased lunch feeling bad about the insufficient efforts, something comes up on her laptop scrolling down a list of adverts, that catches their eye.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		The listing has a gold frame, several positive reviews from those who took up the offer prior, and offers a bit of a different approach than the employer and the soon-to-be-employee on these sites. Rather, the employer is offering to—instead of hiring the employee under the stipulations of the rigid corporate entity, demanding their overtime, and providing potentially unpleasant working conditions—serve more as a loan and mentor.
		<p>
		The process would apparently work something like this: First, the interested party and this woman Maria would have a phone call to answer any questions, and then they would schedule an interview if the opportunity was desired. Then, the “expert mentorship” by Maria would come first, after the contract is signed. And once that was done, and the interested party was ready to take on the career world with their own startup “with the very same knowledge that brought to fame some of the corporate elite,” a loan and other assistance would be distributed. Then all it would be is Maria occasionally checking in to make sure the company is stable or even growing, her new savvy business associate piloting the company. Of course, Ash would also have to pay back the loan and hand over 20% income of the entity to one of Maria's accounts.
		<p>
		It was curious, and much more exciting than office work under someone, to start a company, and Ash could use the support network to get to where they want to be. But they would have to call Maria to really evaluate the supposed generous tycoon for themselves. 
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ash skims through the listing. Then again, thoroughly. Then reads it a third time. It's... Definitely unlike anything she'd seen before, but, to hell with it. It wouldn't hurt to at least inform herself. A solid phone call to end the day would surely leave Ashley more satisfied with the week's efforts, and who knows? Maybe this was the way out of her stale and seemingly dead end almost-poverty life. Even if unsuccessful, the proposed mentoring could be a huge boon for later opportunities. And... They roll their eyes at their own thought, but. If this is some kind of weird front for what ends up being some kind of sexual work, whatever. Maybe that's their line out. Ashley's just a little bit proud of her body.
		<p>
		They reach over and pull their phone from the table beside them. Half past one, it should be a good time to call, they note as they type in the numbers one by one. There's a completely coincidental 666 in the middle of the phone number, and Ash can't help but be amused by that.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		An imp picks up the ring from the desk and flies over to the nearby Mania, a rather potent demoness or “demon goddess” as it had a nicer buzz. She swipes the phone and waves the imp away after the imp had already started to drift back. She places her language and dialect into, after brief consideration for the client, English, New Yorker. ”Hello, this is Maria speaking. Who am I speaking with?” The phone cord dangles above her head, from her perspective; Mania resides in an inverted skyscraper, and her office chair had been bolted to the gray carpeted floor.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ah, the one and only lady Maria herself - Ash is relieved that it wasn't some front desk worker she'd have to hash out any details with. "Yes, hello, my name is Ashley Stirling and I came across a rather intriguing listing with your name and number on it online. I would like to present my sincere interest for this and am quite curious to find out more, if possible." Ugh. Her application script is so second nature by this point, it's even instinctive to use it in a phone call. Hopefully it didn't sound too tinned.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		Mania smiles, and her tail wraps around to her stomach. There's an opportunity here, and not a wrong number. “I'm pleased you called, then. I was the one who put out that ad and you're among the first to call. I'd be happy to answer questions for you, Miss Stirling, as I also understand this opportunity is as unique as they come.” She turns on her monitor and launches a pdf viewer, examining the textboxes in her favorite document.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Something about the voice is quite captivating to Ash, but that's just something that comes with, or is required for being a high class businesswoman. Ashley leans back into their chair. "What sort of requirements does this position have? I didn't see much details on that in the listing, but I assume that means you have faith in the mentoring you have on offer? How long of a process is said mentoring, and would I need to cover for myself in that timeframe? I should be able to, but it's good to ask." She feels... Oddly excited, all of a sudden. Maybe just this is much more of an intriguing position than Ash has been offered lately. Much of the details seem so appealing, and this Maria seems quite charming and elegant.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		She says, “The requirements for this position are that you are over 18 years of age, that you can operate motor vehicles and work everyday computer tasks such as email, Office, and browser, and that you have a great ambition to achieve bigger and greater operations than you ever have before, and greater wealth thereof. If you can't dream big, we will waste both of our time, Miss Sterling.” And although she has much more time than Ashley, her seconds mattered more. “The mentoring is the best you can receive. I am so confident in my mentorship that, in the event you choose to leave the mentorship halfway through, you will experience no fee or judgment. The loan is only once the business is established as well. Please don't leave the mentorship later than halfway, however. That will be penalized.” Mania adjusts some of the text boxes to include these details, for instance this fee that only exists in writing. After all, the loan, business, and training are all a little more instant than estimated, because that's all she has patience for. “The mentorship can be as long as 4 months. You do not need to cover for yourself, no. I have confidence I can inspire the leader in you, especially if our interview together goes well. I am available from 5AM to 11PM Eastern Time seven days a week and can make appointments outside that as well if absolutely necessary.”
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley is silent for a minute, pondering all these details. License, check. Generic computer smarts, check. Ambition? Well. She wants out of this hole and if she ends up captivated, surely that's something that can be dug up from the depths of her deflated self. Until then, a feigned attitude goes a long way. The details all seem very beneficial, getting some temporary compensation and either being mentored well or being able to dip early? A godsend, really. "I am greatly intrigued, Miss..." Oh dear. The last name wasn't actually listed anywhere, but that hadn't actually occurred to them until a second too late. "...ehm, Maria. Let me check my schedule." An artistic pause of a handful of seconds, they already know it's completely void for the time being." I could do it as soon as tomorrow if that's feasible to you? I have an opening after 1pm, but could move some stuff around." She just doesn't want to wake up early, unless she has to. It doesn't quite click with Ashley that Maria offered an 18-hour availability, but it feels off ever so briefly. They shrug it off.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		Mania faces away from her keyboard to write down in a parchment planner in pen the 1PM scheduled appointment. It'd give her a few hours before she had to reap the debt from the Korean tycoon who almost didn't pay off his brokers in time. And unlike the stock to the brokers, he would definitely have his soul on him, as withered as it probably was. A withered and hateful soul is, to a soul, a lot like a withered pepper is to a pepper, on that tangent. It's smaller, yes, but more spicy and flavorful.
		<p>
		“Tomorrow at 1PM works for me... I scheduled us for then. Simply email your address to maria_flecheloo@aol.com. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask, or you can get back to me at this number. I suggest to have your résumé ready. And I'll maybe even bring wine.” She faces her computer and licks her fingernails.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Oh god. A home visit? Maybe Ash should have scheduled not so soon, but now she's set a deadline on herself and backing out of the time now seems like a bad idea. "Oh, no, this all sounds... Good to me." They're already tapping away at their laptop with the other hand. "I'll send you the details asap, hold onnnnn... Okay, there we go. Did you get that? As for further questions, if anything comes to my mind we can take that up tomorrow." Ashley is nervous, all of a sudden. Is she really ready for all this? Probably not, but she's been ready to change her life somehow for too long and this is an opportunity unlike anything else.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		So Ash was computer literate. She'd regret that. Her bloated email client dings. “Grand. I did receive your email, thank you. And, of course, I will have much to ask about tomorrow. Okay, sleep easy tonight, Miss Stirling. I must go now—” She hangs up with a button on the phone and drops the phone, which hangs past her brilliant white hair for an imp, a new one, to collect and return to its dock. She publishes the pdf and sets it to print in a different floor, a few copies to be safe. She could wait until thirty minutes prior to the meeting, or maybe she could watch a new international box office film in the meantime with warm champagne. She didn't sleep.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ash waits for the call to end. Double checks twice that Maria is no longer on the line. They put their phone away, and...
		<p>
		"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,,,"
		<p>
		Okay. Good. That had to get out. 
		<p>
		Sleeping easy seemed like a very tall order, but they had to do their best to be awake and presentable tomorrow. And apparently that includes the house too. Oh well, seems like rewatching the fifth harry potter movie this evening had to be cancelled for tonight. She piles away her newspapers, taking care to include the one tossed aside earlier, and breathes deeply a few times before setting to work. It's 2am by the time Ashley is halfway satisfied and they slump to bed, sleeping instantly.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		There was a lot of overcast in the morning, so much so that it resembled the crack of dawn. But, by noon, the sky cleared to a blue—a blue, of course, despite the polluting city below. Minutes before one o'clock, the elevator in Ashley Stirling's apartment building chimes at her floor. And, as the elevator doors part, Mania dressed in a bold red close-fitting dress with a cleavage window—redecorated in pale skin and dark hair—drops from the dull and red-tinted ceiling onto the ground and then walks forward into the hallway. The elevator closes behind her in an unnatural, short time frame, aware of her absence, and plummets back to where it came from. She clamps a bottle of champagne in her right hand, resting the surface along her whole twisted right arm and resting the bottom against her shoulder. And, in her left hand, she holds a two dollar folder. She knocks on Ashley's door with this hand.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Not the brightest and most awake but rested enough to be presentable, Ashley perches up on their toes to take a peek through the peekhole in her front door. To at least have a moment of mental preparation of what's waiting on the other side—Woah. This was not your everyday lady, certainly. The door slowly opens, and Ashley can't resist a slow up and down scan of their visitor. "Maria, I presume? You're very precisely on time. Please, come in. Apologies if this is all a bit... Modest for your tastes." Ashley indicates a place to leave shoes, and then leads the way back to her unusually tidy living room. There's a tea kettle and two cups prepared on either side of the table and a few papers in a neat little pile next to the cup that Ashley chooses as their own.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		Mania smiles with a plastic glimmer. "Of course. And, yes, it's very modest. That's why I'm here to change your life, Ms. Stirling. Remember, we dream big." She places the champagne bottle on the table with the tea kettle and cups, and she sits with her heels clicked together. Her eyes match up to Ashley's with an alien ferocity. "I mentioned I might bring wine. Although I almost did, I changed my mind and brought champagne instead. It tends to symbolize the start of something new... To start with, I'd love a look over your paper resume. And then I'll ask you questions that every interviewee has to answer as well. Feel free to ask questions of your own about this position."
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley pulls one of the papers out of the pile, places it down and spins it on the tabletop with her fingers before sliding it over to Maria's side. It's a mighty modest résumé, but there's two charity projects, a strongly passable education and a few snippets of work in there. Some IT certifications too, and as mentioned a general class license. "I do have many questions, you've been as mysterious as you've been intriguing with your offer. But you seem a very competent woman so I do have faith." Also, they're just desperate. "This mentoring, I realize I didn't ask, will it be local or digital? Either works fine."
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		Mania reads the resume only a touch more patient than the typical employer, more scanning than anything. "Your charity work is noble, if quaint. I delight in seeing your ability to contribute rise once we get you sitting pretty in a business. Your charity work could be massive... But I read that you did not manage to stay in the office position much longer than a few months. I'll mentor you well; in any case, it's just something to keep in mind for us both. It'll be a combination of local and digital mentoring. Now..." She stretches out her arms, admiring her own dark fingernails. "Describe to me a time you acted on your own accord when you needed to most."
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		"The office position was a very unfortunate story. I assure you I did my best, but management was... highly defiant about changing their horridly unoptimized systems and practices. As you said, we need to dream big, and apparently dreaming of an actually functional registry system was seen as causing difficulties when clearly the changes I was proposing and offering were vast improvements." They drum their fingers slightly. "I wouldn't tell these details to any old office manager, of course, but you seem a woman who appreciates forward thinking and innovation." 
		<p>
		Being asked vague and complicated interview questions was always a hassle, but she knows to try her best. They pinch the bridge of their nose briefly, in thought, then note. "Well, there's the case of when, during the later charity work, some details felt off and I chose to pursue them. Long story short, someone had been diverting a fraction of the charity funds for their own pleasure and by pushing the right questions I managed to get someone higher up to look into it and notice the offset without putting my name in the mix." Something about this answer felt overly... Honest, but it's the first thing that came to mind.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		The woman of hell gazes at Ms. Stirling's hazel eyes at the compliment, and she puts her hands and pretty nails overtop the unemployed person's own, halting their drumming. "Thank you, Ms. Stirling. I do. It's part of my, and soon to be also yours, brand." Mania lifts her hand and smiles again. "These are both great answers, even the story about the management being unwilling to accept optimization of your own suggestion. You've knocked out my second question before I even presented it, then, and so I'd like to ask you my third and final interview question." She collects the folder onto the table, over Ashley's resume, and leans over it until she's remarkably inches from her face. "Describe someone or some group you know you're better than and why. Someone outside of your resume."
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley's gaze has wandered over to their own hand, where Maria's fingers had been resting. When she's suddenly faced with a fairly uncomfortable closeness, she gasps and leans back a bit, but doesn't object. She's too preoccupied on the presented question to start pondering Maria's motives and growing peculiar manners. Her mind is distracted all of a sudden, leaning away from the formal and well thought out responses she would usually manage.
		<p>		
		"My parents. Maybe a generic and obvious answer for many people, but. They got me in this position to begin with. They only wished to support a very narrow line of progression for me so when I started to seek my own goals they fell off very quick. I had faith in them keeping me up for longer when I broke off from the trail I was lead onto and they let me fall. I'll prove them wrong some day and when they plead forgiveness I won't listen. I will have made it without them." There's a growing, spiteful tone to all of this and once she's done, once she realizes, she becomes quite flustered. "That... That was very out of line, apologies..."
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		Mania has a way with prying sin away from the deep recesses of the subconscious. She leans back from Ashley and winks, and she shoves the folder and resume below over to her side of the table, facing Ashley. She says, with ginger, "No need for apologies. I've already decided that you're hired. Training with you will be excellent and straight-forward. All your answers will remain confidential, I assure you, as a side note. However, there's one last step, Ms. Stirling, to finally make it in the world to your full potential, to prove everyone wrong about you." Her breath seems to have a bit of... heat? "..A contract you must sign on the line in the folder." The folder has a red pen and at least four pages of contract to perhaps read, front-to-back, with the signature line on the first page.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		It's hard to tell if Maria is acting odd or of Ashley's just too caught up by the complicated situation to read the signs properly. They dismiss it, and browse the contract swiftly. It feels like... Looking at the papers, it feels more like information appears in her brain rather than she's actually focused on and reading the words. Ash doesn't dwell on this weird sensation though, the parts that have been skimmed seem... In order? She thinks. Nothing odd here, certainly. 
		<p>
		She takes the pen, carefully doodling a spiral on one of her own papers to make sure it writes to their liking. The signature is a bit scratchy, but it's barely legible as "ASterling". The pen drops to the table, in a decisive gesture. And... Hm. She's not sure how to feel. Not sure what they are feeling.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		Mania sweeps back the signed paper and folder from Ms. Stirling, and she then places them both on her seat directly under her dress. In the meantime, she also pops open the champagne bottle and pours to the top of the smaller tea cups, each and both. Mania drinks down one cup very quickly, almost as if it was water, and then says, "You won't regret this. You will prefer what I've done for you. And finally you will be able to seek your career aspirations to an end. You will be richer, more powerful, better. All without anyone's help but mine and yours." Mania, from hair to dress to skin, glows with a soft, red luminescence. She stands from her seat and walks up to a wall, putting her hand on it. The edges of Ashley's vision accumulate darkness.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley takes the cup, slightly amused by the odd combination of vessel and contents. She won't complain though- At least not at that. What's more worrisome is Maria's sudden radiance, the slowly swimming vision. The first instinct is the drink being poisoned, but. It was so incredibly fast acting in that case, and Maria had shared it too. Other explanations fade in, her eyes falling to the contract on the seat. They don't understand, but they can just vaguely whisper out a few words.
		<p>
		"What did you do...?" 
		<p>
		Ash feels ready to slump over and pass out. Either by whatever is affecting her, or from pure anxiety in the moment.
		</div><div class="wrap Mania_w"><p>
		Mania pushes off the wall and flips one-hundred and eighty degrees, landing on the ceiling. Mania's figure is engulfed in a new splotch of darkness in Ashley's vision briefly before the darkness vanishes just as it came, leaving only the darkness that still encroaches from the edges of her vision. She's no longer wearing a red dress, but a red skimpy bra and gold panty. Her skin looks as if her previous skin was entirely burnt by the sun—red, with amazing complexion. And her hair goes from black to a pure white. Her eyes reveal themselves to be orange as well. And her tail forms again and swishes behind her. Mania, the CEO of Hell, walks up to Ashley and puts her middle and index fingers across her lips. Ashley's vision is narrowed to just the demoness. "Hired you."
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Even if Mania is all that Ashley can see, their eyes fail to focus properly. There's so much to take in, and the brain refuses to acknowledge the truth that is appearing. And yet, she chuckles. "I've always joked about not wanting to sell my soul to my jobs. I guess a deal with a demon isn't that far off..." Ashley's voice trails off, and they fall over onto the coffee table. Unconscious or just entirely mentally resigned, it's hard to tell.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		--------------------
		<br>
		Miss Ashley Stirling stirs in a king-sized bed. When they open their eyes, with the memories of the night crashing back, with the very lovely bedroom with a fine layer of lavender paint on all walls and modern interior, they find the bedroom alien and yet seemingly groomed to them. Like, there are sleek and dark cabinets and a computer desk with a finely-tuned chair. Has Mania pimped their decor? Well, no. There's more space in this room than the entirety of Ashley’s apartment, and there's a window that, from their bed, only has scattering of skyscrapers against the sky. Mania is nowhere to be seen, but the edges of Ashley’s vision recede the last of the dark cloud.
		<p>
		They really, really want coffee, and there's no kettle or coffee machine here.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ash slowly accustoms her vision to her surroundings, confusion and discomfort settling in more and more with each little observation. The bed is much comfortable though, and their silken nightgown is very pleasant too. There's a three minute segment of trying to reason this into being a dream or not, and the verdict unfortunately lands on this being reality. Slowly slinking out of bed, she places herself in the office chair by the computer and taps in the password.  Ashley has never used that password before, and is startled by how natural it fell to her fingers. 
		<p>
		"Ugh, why do I crave coffee? I'm not even a coffee person. I think? Maybe... Maybe not. I'll give it a try."
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The computer greets her with about ten open tabs and an email client. And, to their horror, their inbox is flooded with dozens of emails from just the last night. And, interestingly, not a single one of them appears to be spam—they are all addressed to her. Perhaps that's the end of the grocery store membership card emails, at least...
		<p>
		Before Ashley can settle in to seeing the contents of the emails in detail or anything other than the first open tab being a login to some sort of corporate web portal, the phone on their desk vibrates the dark wood material. It's definitely not their phone, but she knows the password for it, too, and knows she’s meant to pick it up.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		There's something clearly wrong, but Ashley knows she has to play along for now. They've idly taken in some movies on the matter, and need to make time to figure things out before things get out of hand. They pick up the call, gently resting their phone between their head and shoulder so they can continue browsing emails with both hands.
		<p>
		"Miss Stirling, hello?"
		</div><div class="wrap Madrigal_w"><p>
		"Hey, so I was going to send you my list of candidates for the missing position in the third design group but unfortunately I got tangled in your other request to probe a contract with the retail distributor in Alaska? They were not biting, pretended like they didn't even know who we are, so I had to setup a presentation for them even though I guarantee you they're just playing stupid. I hate them. So should I work on the candidates and postpone the presentation to the evening or tomorrow?"
		<p>
		The woman talks over any of their oohs and aahs. They hear mild background conversation zip past her, and the echo of her hallway. It's sort of giving them a headache, nothing coffee couldn't fix. The emails are sometimes similar questions, all worded immaculately, one of them being noticeably of the same subject line as the woman's on the phone, from "Bailey Madrigal." Some other emails are stranger, suggesting they want assets or shares Ms. Stirling has and offering her their own shares or assistance.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Oh god. Dream big... Ashley ponders back to the things the overly inappropriate demon that swims in her mind had said. She'd been hired? Is this their job now? Pieces are starting to line up and the answers are not pleasant.
		<p>
		"Send the presentation first. I'll need some... time to be ready for the applications anyhow. It's one of those mornings, and I need some coffee. I trust you to figure things out." 
		<p>
		Ashley opens the email, trying to find some more information on this Bailey. And information in general. This ache for coffee is almost sickening, in how unfamiliar but pervasive it is.
		</div><div class="wrap Madrigal_w"><p>
		"Jesus, alright, I'll get you coffee." She hangs up.
		<p>
		Reading more of the email and similar emails sent prior from Ms. Madrigal, it's pretty clear she's Ms. Stirling's primary secretary, specifically tasked with their most personal requests and helping guide or even coerce the rest of the senior executive team just under... them. In fact, as they finally get in print on a separate email from a Chinese interested party, Ms. Stirling is the CEO of this place, this "Excalibur" Incorporated. And this company apparently sells... knives and lasers, to retail, other corporate, and maybe government...
		<p>
		They hear a door crack open in the adjacent room. Bailey calls in their direction, spitting in seconds, "Your coffee! Same as always. Anything else?" The CEO hears the ceramic mug sit. 
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Throwing what seems to be a bit of a presentable overcoat over their nightgown, they head over to the other room. Sizing up their supposed Secretary. Ash feels terrible, and realizes it's best to let that show, if nothing than to try to garner some pity from the secretary. She takes the mug, pinching the bridge of their nose slightly and sighing deeply. "Apologies if that came across as demanding. Something is wrong... What's on the schedule today, Bailey? My head is a mess. I might have to cancel some meetings." 
		<p>
		A CEO, huh. That's certainly quite a raise from being unemployed. More and more details that come up seem eerily familiar, as if this is somehow their life and has been. And still, it's such an uncomfortable fit. This isn't what they were looking for, and their past... well, memory-past, not CEO-past, has left them with heavy biases against people like... Themselves, in their current state. The presumably rich elite. 
		</div><div class="wrap Madrigal_w"><p>
		Bailey raises her eyebrow and walks back to close the door she came in from, locking it. And she approaches her boss again with a folder, and opens it. What is it with folders? "These were on schedule today. Fortunately for you, you weren't in a particular meeting today; you were mostly requested to check the internal work in the research laboratory to your specifications. Might have forgot then it was Tuesday? But uh. Don't apologize to me. Something does seem wrong. Why are you..?" She addresses Ashley's nightgown in her executive office. "I can arrange someone to check your temperature and give you meds, if you like."
		<p>
		Still, Ms. Stirling's memory-past had somehow more reality than this world. Something about this reality was shadowy, only still coming together. They, for instance, can't remember their last lunch as well as they can in their memory-past. Their harry potter movie rewatch still was waiting.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Tuesday? It most definitely was Friday yesterday. Whatever was going on, it was bad, really bad. World-changingly so. And a certain Maria was responsible for it. Demonic and with the power to alter reality? Ashley was in some deep shit. 
		<p>
		They eye over the folder, taking note of the sleek logo for Excalibur. At least their CEO-self had good taste in design, or at least in which designers to hire. "I'll see if I can get my bearings with just some coffee, but if it persists I'll take you up on that offer. I'll have to see when I can take the time for that research on a day that is not today, I hope that doesn't get too much in the way of their scheduling. Tell them to have the time off if they can't fit something else in the timeframe. Or if they really want to anyways. This one's on me." 
		<p>
		They scan over the office, trying to get some more insight but just seeming even more out of shape and slightly bewildered while doing so.
		</div><div class="wrap Madrigal_w"><p>
		Bailey seems quiet for a moment. She produces her own phone, then, and shrugs at her. And she calls off the research lab progress check-in and quality assurance from Ms. Stirling herself. The engineers and scientists go ahead and take the time off, not really minding one way or the other why, and a few stick around for measurements and a scientific paper. And then Bailey thanks them and hangs up. She just stares at her boss drinking coffee with her sugar and cream. Like Miss Sterling hasn't worked here nearly every day for the past couple years. "Is there something you're looking for? Look, it's my job to attend to your problems at your discretion... I'm going to go ahead and call up that nurse, though. Just call me." She starts toward the office door. 
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley doesn't comment, and just nods along. Once she's finally alone, she returns to her room and falls face first onto her bed. This is all a lot to take in, and there's so many expectations they have not a single clue how to fulfill yet. Despite their best efforts, it seems the secretary has already assumed them terribly sick and maybe some amount of spontaneously deranged. Which wouldn't be too wrong from her perspective, Ash supposes. Meetings, tech research to attend to. 
		<p>
		The first manner of order would be to get properly dressed and scan through the office for anything of valuable personal information. A diary would be a godsend but they weren't one to write one, generally. But for now, lying face down in the bed and moping seems to do the trick. The coffee was surprisingly a taste their body tolerates, and the more indirect effects of caffeine are setting in. Is this what dependency is like? Probably.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		It's a quiet several minutes. Reality itself may be different, and they may be the figurehead of the wealth disparity of the country they so criticized before, but the bed is warm and soft. They're still Miss Stirling in their close quarters all the same. Ashley. Ashley Stirling.
		<p>
		But the nurse unlocks the office with a key she was handed from the secretary, and she locks it behind her. She rolls a cart and table with several over-the-counter medications and shiny medical equipment into the center of the office and then the bedroom. "Executive Stirling, please, feel free to make yourself comfortable in your bed. What symptoms did you wake up with this morning?" She's older than the executive or the secretary by a couple decades, and she's blonde, tall, and soft-spoken. 
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		As requested, Ashley sits up in a more proper manner, as proper as she can manage in this state. "It's... Hard to explain. Not to make this seem overly dramatic, but. There's this sense of not being quite myself, you see? I wake up, I check my phone, but despite knowing how to do these things it doesn't feel familiar. I'm having a hard time even remembering how exactly the 'usual' Miss Stirling acts." 
		<p>
		She realizes that this ramble sounds absolutely odd but there's maybe some underlying misplaced hope that somehow, the nurse knows more than she should. Ash sighs, deeply. "Maybe it's just some manner of stress reaction, who knows. I just worry what might happen if this persists."
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The nurse nods her head and scribbles some of these described symptoms or theories onto the clipboard on the top of the cart. She's closed the door to the bedroom, and she says, "I see... You're displaying symptoms such as detachment, memory loss, a general lack of enthusiasm, anxiety... I think your hunch is a strong candidate, and you're experiencing great stress. So much is expected from you and it's grown exponentially in the past year alone. Please, Executive Stirling, how do you usually act, if you can recall? And how do you feel right now, if we haven't discussed that fully? Is it different from how you have felt a few months ago?"
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley scratches their head quite decisively. Trying to reawaken whatever lingering memories might be in the physical part of her brain. Trying to "recollect" things that she for all intents and purposes never knew. "I feel, overwhelmed mostly. As if I've rediscovered my status and position all anew. As if it just now clicked with me that I'm the CEO of a large company, that I have so much responsibility, and I never was quite aware of this before..." It's not a lie, truly, any of this. But it's very much not a direct explanation either.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		"I see..." She says again. She stands more to their bedside, dragging the cart with her, and she rummages through the labels and pill bottles. She blinks as she writes something else hasty, and she faces them. "I will run this by our network soon. But I'm confident what you are experiencing, Executive Stirling, is very treatable and common among young professionals at all levels of society. You will be back to your normal self in a few days, most likely, if you give yourself some time to reflect and relax. I know it's hard, but you could really need it." The nurse pauses. She holds up a needle. The Excalibur logo shines on the base of the metal, where it's much wider. "We should take a blood sample as well. Do you have anything else you'd want to tell me?" 
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		There's no real reason to object, and if anything was physically wrong with this new and yet familiar body, it would be in her best interest to find out anyhow. So she drops off her overcoat and pushes back the sleeve on her nightgown, offering it to the nurse. "I... Think that's it. Hard to say for sure, of course, with my state. If anything serious comes up I'll have Bailey... Miss Madrigal note you. Thank you for your efforts. I'll try to limit my hours, certainly. I have competent people to rely on, I suspect."
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The nurse places a thin, protective, square, transparent patch over the large vein she intends to poke the needle into, and she then lines the needle and does so. Stirling feels an almost disturbingly minimal tug of the skin, the smallest blister of sensation, as the needle breaks through their skin and recedes out once the vial is filled with the red stuff. And the nurse bandages the spot, over the patch. "Of course, Executive. It's the job. But, you know our number if Miss Madrigal needs to get in contact with us again, yes. Enjoy the fruits of your labor for now." The nurse carts out of the room with the vial placed in a zippy bag, the tip of the needle places in a medical cloth. And she's left in the dimly lit bedroom alone once again.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		It makes sense that Excalibur has an expertise in research and sharp objects, and Ashley thanks whatever process that lead them here for at least acknowledging their appeals and interests. It's astounding how precise this Excalibur brand implement is, and she can't help but be impressed. Did she really achieve this, in this other life? In a twisted sense, she's proud of herself. Dream big. 
		<p>
		And still, the deep pit in their stomach opens again once they're done playing theatrics for unknowing onlookers. They didn't ask for this, they're not built to be a businessperson with probably limited regard for others. Bailey's reaction was pretty telling, it seems the CEO Ashley was a bit of a dick... What even happened to them, when unemployed Ash took over? This is a weird existential thread they refuse to go down right now, actually. 
		<p>
		They get dressed. They're not at all familiar with this expensive and stylish business attire but the process of putting it on is second-hand natural motions. If only memories were so quick to be in place, they'd have this much more insight.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The outfit is tasteful, at least. Consisting of a light gray skirt, white blouse, and proper gray vest. Seeing themselves in the bedroom's full-body mirror is most assuring that they at least look the part in it. It tempts a smile.
		<p>
		It's habitual to check her emails in this reality, although she can quit at any time she reminds herself. The client has already updated with a dozen emails from last time, including a notice about when the medical information is projected to return—a couple days from now unless something serious came from one of the tests that completes sooner. Miss Stirling knows she's meant to update her senior executive team about her status for the next few days, though, and makes that the focus, creating the subject body for such an email. However, there is an email that comes in during this process. The subject line reads, "Hey it's Nole From Economics!" Not only was there a Nole from Economics for this Ashley Stirling, but Ashley was sure the guy she was adjusted to from economics in her original life's college was also called Nole.
		<p>
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Nole... Nole. Nole the economics guy. So college might have been mostly the same still, they note, and pin another red thread to the growing noticeboard in their brain. Disregarding all the work related emails feels uncomfortable, but there might be interesting details to find from this Nole so she opens it up to scour for information. 
		<p>
		Well, after completing the internal notice, of course.
		<p>
		> Just a heads up, unforeseen circumstances have gotten in the way and I'll be less able to respond to or participate in business matters for a few days forward. I put my trust in you, and I'll want proper reports on anything that happens outside of my usual direct supervision. 
		<p>
		> Ashley Stirling
		<br>
		> CEO
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		Nole's email is polite and unprofessional. Instead, Nole is requesting that him and her get in contact with one another again sometime over the phone or maybe even in person. He happens to live in Stirling's city, on the outskirts. Not too remarkable since the college they went to is also of this state, but nevertheless a nice coincidence. He leaves his phone number as well, and he clarifies that he's "ecstatic they went so far with their passion and their career" and how he remembers them just in a study group together slacking off and sometimes even putting a movie on.
		<p>
		When they check their other tabs, it's a slew of scientific articles, their last bank statement, and a restaurant menu. The scientific articles aren't all from Excalibur, actually, many from outside university work. Her lab workers probably sent her this.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		There's no way to tell if this is a good idea or a terrible idea. But the itch to work despite already having called off for the time being could do with a real distraction. In hindsight, she doesn't even know when she woke up today - It's only 9 am? She's definitely been up for at least an hour. Fucking hell. That's the business life, she supposes. 
		<p>
		Ashley has vague own memories of watching movies with Nole. It was mostly generic popular content, some documentaries. Being able to connect with him might be a good way to stabilize and still gain insight from the time that's diverged. She types out a response. 
		<p>
		> Hi, Nole. 
		<br>
		> As you can imagine, I am a very busy lady generally. But you're in luck; I have a bit of an unusual opening the next few days. Apologies if this is a bit of a short notice, but how does a chat at...
		<p>
		Ashley has to make sure the place she is thinking of still exists in this timeline. A quick search says it does. Okay, good, she's not making a complete lunatic out of herself this time. 
		<p>
		> ...Café Soleil, tomorrow at noon, sound? I haven't reminisced enough on the past lately. 
		<p>
		> Ashley Stirling
		<br>
		> CEO, Excalibur
		<p>
		Actually, she erases that last line. The formality sits seep in their fingers but it just feels out of place here. 
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The email is sent. And since Nole's email was only sent a couple minutes prior, there's a quick and pleasant response.
		<p>
		> Thank you!
		<br>
		> I look forward to connecting again at the cafe. I'm really honored you have time for me in that life. I'll see you then!
		<p>
		> Nole
		<p>
		Still, the day is early, there is more coffee to be had in several hours, and this is tomorrow they are talking about meeting. Stirling's attention drifts toward the scientific work on nanotechnology and micromaterials on the tab. Certainly, in this timeline, they have much more work and expertise than even a bit of university. The snippets of memory here sometimes include borderline obsession, times spent dusk to dawn trying to design perfect cutlery, and then funding through a research grant physically, precisely, creating them. And then marketing them and dropping out, like anyone who's become above the intended education and career path. Dream big. Surpassing every expectation, and pushing people to get there, including themselves.
		<p>
		In any case, Stirling can now comfortably order food delivery anytime she wants, and she's feeling lunch.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley scans through the phone, for apps. Food delivery services are of course on the list. They scan through some of the backlogs, trying to get some sense of what manner of meals they have partaken in the last few weeks. They order something lighter off this list, since their appetite is still being rivalled by the deeply unsettling and unhappy feelings. Bailey gets a small phone message.
		<p>
		Lunch delivery will be here in about twenty minutes. Tell front desk to send it to my office when it arrives. -Ashley
		<p>
		The memories are intriguing, and Ash closes her eyes to try to invite more of it... Cutlery, huh. Makes sense. Shaping of metal, precision, sharpness. She's not sure where she'd have that money and support though - Oh, ugh. Surely her family enjoyed this version of Miss Stirling becoming a businessperson with large aspirations. They had resources, after all, to kickstart her if they had actually cared to in the other time. So this wasn't even truly a self-made wealth, probably, they'd likely been coasting off family funds. Sigh.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The consequence of fortune early in life is sitting too pretty from the start... Sure, the university granted funds for her expert initiatives, but Ashley was struggling with a job and college in her original life. It's much the reason she never progressed into university there. Here... Well, she had no memory of working cashier or food line. Just college, just young experiences, just this research and fondness for the sharp objects and—in university—nanomaterials and optics.
		<p>
		Worse, their parents met with them after their first distribution online. And it was the most proud and joyous they've been, in any timeline. Their vision of a successful daughter was realized. Of course... They grew distant. Seeing but less than annually. But, in a way, the "high" from their pride never went away. Their relationship to her became... symbolic. Bragging rights.
		<p>
		Executive Stirling felt smug, thinking about it. Sometime later, her lunch arrives to her office in the hand of an intern knocking the door. 
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Reliving these foreign memories is incredibly eerie, but the sense of actual insight and knowledge is in itself much more comforting than being entirely lost and basically being an acting amnesiac from this day on. So... Food. She takes quick look in the mirror to be at least passable in expression despite her stressed and terrible state, and then enters her office to accept the lunch with a throwaway comment of appreciation before seeing them off and closing the door again. Making sure it's locked, of course. They sit down at the office desk, and rummage a bit through the drawers in between. Familiarizing themselves with locations of trivial office objects in case they might need them later.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		There's a couple objects of note: a keychain with a few keys, including a Bluetooth car key; a set of gray ball-point ink pens of varying thickness; a black wallet with a few more credit cards than a sane person would own; a passport; and the most incredible custom switch knife. The edges of the blade, on close inspection, are serrated in an almost alien design. And different protrusions of the finely-toothed design are varying colors of gray and even purple. Stirling, eventually, remembers that this is one of their latest experimental designs, not even demonstrated yet to an interested manufacturer or national hospital. And of course, the symbol of Excalibur is there again on the cool handle. A sword, both abstracted into shapes and yet composed and inspiring. It always points toward a circle of light.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley takes a credit card out, and gently lets her hand guide itself. It instinctively traces out the muscle memory motion of typing a keypad, 7-6-1-4. So that's her code, apparently. 
		<p>
		Good. She has access to her money. She puts the card back, making sure it's the front one for easy access and not taking one of the many others instead. The knife, she twists and inspects and is honestly in great awe of. This is the kind of thing she'd dream of as a student with a fascination for pointy things. There's a strong urge to find a random object to try with it, and she settles on pulling out an empty plastic folder from one of her cabinets. 
		<p>
		It splits in half with an almost seductive grace. Mmm.
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The knife leaves an impression that few materials are safe. 
		<p>
		After they've finished eating and having some water, and all the drawers have been examined for interesting, non-work content... Ashley is left again to her thoughts, and the executive aspects of her feel almost stuffy without something to scratch the itch of her familiar leadership. The days of drinking tea and thinking of nothing at all for a few minutes, unless they can convince the demoness to give her old life back, are over. Her compulsion to check the computer returns, but she tries to shove the idea away for now. She remembers that she has a sense of fun and indulgence in this universe as well through some examples. They remember that travel in the past couple years, business-inspired but also leisure. She remembers using her fortune, as much as her fame in enterprise, to inspire strange bedfellows— often not in good faith.
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Surfacing thoughts of action in bed that she can't even consider her own? Now that's quite awkward. And just a little bit hot to think back at. With the variety of girls she's bedded, there's surely been some or other celebrity news mention about her having possible partners or not. But that's really not what she's looking for - Probably the entire world knows she's gay though, as a result. 
		<p>
		She can't tell if the tingly feeling in her stomach is from just how sexy this knife is, or if it's the more potent memories of bedding people. Oh well, no time to dwell on that. She'll surely get her real share of that eventually, if she desires. They've dug into some of their lunch, it's good food and it somewhat dispels the feelings that tried to void her appetite. Maybe having money isn't so bad... Ugh. It's not even been half a day and she worries about becoming complacent. Who knows where she'll be in a week if this continues.
		</div><div class="wrap Madrigal_w"><p>
		--------------------
		<br>
		Bailey sighs and presses into the executive's office with a small tray of cookies. She closes her eyes and passes the tray atop a countertop aside the main workspace, which is empty save for a couple knives out of their shelves. She creaks the door open to the bedroom, and she says, “I've seen your email, and I've seen the nurse's evaluation. You're not the first person I've worked for that became stressed, although I think you might have had the worst reaction—no offense, please, Miss Stirling. You're still handling things well. And your staff will manage... Ms. Mica in the retail department sent you chocolate cookies if you wish, they're by the fridge.” 
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Chocolate cookies do sound very appealing currently. Ms. Mica... Something about the name unlocks good brain chemicals in Ashley's head. She supposes that said Ms. Mica is just a very likeable and good person then. "Do send her my thanks, and thank you too for bringing them. I do trust in the staff to do well without me for now. I kind of have to, after all. But Excalibur certainly makes good things and it's been a group effort." They don't take any offense, considering the situation is indeed much worse than Bailey would know or ever understand. "Considering I've already called off all my attendance, I do suppose I should take a trip outside. Get some fresh air, and some motion. The last thing I'd want to do is waste away in my room. I'll have a cookie first, of course."  Ashley stands up and stretches, having already spent a bit too long in bed again... She has a slight itch building. Taking time off as a CEO seems to be more difficult than one would suppose.
		</div><div class="wrap Madrigal_w"><p>
		“She'll be delighted to know. And, yes, Excalibur is many moving, carefully collaborating components and an industry giant.” Miss Madrigal steps back from the door and then leans against the wall. “Well, Executive, wouldn't that pretty much be a conflict of interest with Nurse Emily's recommendations? I agree that you should not simply be in your bed the whole time; however, I think it's sometimes stressful, actually, to show your face in this city. Should we reserve a private flight to somewhere a little farther instead? Consider it an insisted company retreat?” Her gaze glides up to the ceiling LED, and she kicks her heel up on her other shoe. “Anyway, please, have as many cookies as you need. You're fond of them... I'm thinking an island, though.”
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		"I already have a personal meeting scheduled tomorrow so I can't exactly travel far away. You do raise a point, but fresh air does still appeal much to me. I'll simply keep to myself and ignore the weirder ones. If things go less than preferred I'll be back sooner." She stands and evaluates her outfit. It's very smart and business-y, maybe a bit too much for a casual outing. They have no idea what manner of replacements would be in the closet, but it'd be worth a look- God, taking a trip to an island appeals more than it should, truly. But she can't do that to poor Nole, and barring more thorough flashbacks to her alternate past she wouldn't learn much just resting among any palm trees. 
		<p>
		"We could go to an island some other time. I don't want to lose too much familiarity with my surroundings in this state, either." She does finally approach the cookies, sitting down in their office chair and carefully savoring the chocolatey flavor. Mmm.
		</div><div class="wrap Madrigal_w"><p>
		Bailey laughs. “Excuse me, then. The 'personal meeting' hopefully will not have anything to do with Excalibur, then, and perhaps we'll see how you feel about getting out of this place after the meeting. Enjoy yourself, CEO.” She takes a tall, glass bottle of water from the fridge and pours some of it into a sleek cup, and she takes the glass to Miss Stirling's desk, shadowing their shoulder. “Well, you know what I think: the city is drab. But if you want to see the same old places on your dedicated hours off, I will tend to the rest of the office, I think. I've left you some water.” She saunters away, smiling from sight. Resting her hand on the door knob to the office. “Please, if there's anything else you need, especially this week, message or call. I'll go see Ms. Mica.” 
		</div><div class="wrap Ashley_w"><p>
		Ashley takes the cup, and a long swig of the liquid. It's good. "You're good to me, Bailey. Thank you for all your hard work, I certainly feel much more confident in a time with less engagement with you to cover me. I'll try to not be too brought down by this drab little town then, as I saunter about." Miss Stirling politely waves off their assistant, and returns to the other room with a half-eaten cookie. 
		<p>
		A rummage through the clothes storage does reveal, tucked away to the side in an almost undignified manner, some outfitting that while still smart and expensive is slightly too casual to wear at a company meeting. She'd noted a big pair of sunglasses too in her office desk, and would surely like to take those too. It's a fairly bright day and masking her confused stares should do well for any unexpected media presence. They don't know what to expect in this alternate timeline of their own home city, but with a stylish purse carrying all their personal odds and ends they are ready to find out. 
		<p>
		Actually, she has one more cookie first, and wipes off her lips with a fine towel. Ashley simply doesn't think much as she leaves the building, letting habit guide her steps rather than having to follow the signs in her own establishment.
