	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape holds her forehead and stretches her legs, many hours later. She realizes she's forgotten to discard
			the rune stones back to the safe, so she quietly grabs the stones individually and tucks them under the bed
			on her side. And she watches as this sort of stirring has disturbed Silver's delicate rest. She addresses
			her with a smile, and she says, "Well, it's nothing fancy here but I hope you had a good rest. Hey Silver."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver shifts slightly, and makes some kind of snoozy noise. The realization that she's gone to sleep in all
			her clothes makes her awaken slightly faster.
		<p>
			"Mmh? What? Shape?" She stretches, and slowly sits up while trying to recollect the peculiar position she's
			found herself in.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape giggles. And she sits up a bit more against the back of the bed, onto her pillow. "We got a bit sleepy
			and went to bed is all, so I was just hoping it was a cozy bed. Maybe some good dreams... Last night was
			fun! We got to know each other a bit, we got to see some casual magic. We played that board game."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver gently rubs her eyes out, and eyes over the green lady beside her. "Magic..." The details are coming
			back, and she feels some amounts of unwell at the realization of things she said, of how much wine she had,
			how detailed her various descriptions were. This wasn't like Silver.
		<p>
			"It was... Something, I suppose." She rubs her arm in a somewhat awkward manner.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah. It was." Shape blinks, and then she glances around the somewhat sparse room. There's not even a
			poster on the wall. "You must be hungry. I'll go run downstairs and make us a spot of breakfast. What do you
			like to eat, Silver? For this time, anyway... Maybe an early lunch instead of breakfast if you want too."
			Shape climbs out of the sheets and bed gingerly, her bra strap stretched over her back in clear view of
			Silver.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I... Don't really know. Anything will do, probably." Silver climbs out the other side of the bed, and looks
			over her clothes. She does not feel very presentable, having slept in them instead of some proper nightwear.
			"I might not even be that hungry."
		<p>
			She isn't very subtle about seeming off. She pulls out her phone and does a habitual check for appointments,
			messages and the likes.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape walks to Silver's side of the room, and she yawns. She gazes at Silver again by the door with her
			green eyes. "Hey, Silver, is everything all right? You seem... I guess distracted, maybe sad? I'm here for
			you, you know. I'm your friend. And maybe I have a few years of experience too you know." She brushes her
			hair from her lips.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			She sits down on the bedside again, and sighs most deeply. "I said so many things, yesterday. Too much, I
			feel. I was just caught up in things. And I usually do not like drinking as much. I'm not even sure I was
			really being myself, in the end. That isn't how things are meant to be. I'm rambling, and I don't ramble
			often." She doesn't seem to be faring better from talking so much about it, appearing slightly stressed as a
			result instead. "Maybe I should just be alone soon so I can think."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape leans against the door and breathes in deeply in return. Her fingers wander into each other. "Hmm. I'm
			sorry about the drinking. Next time we should probably avoid that, yeah. But I don't think it affected you
			that much, I mean... Maybe you like to ramble in my presence, you know? Maybe that's just what we do as
			people who've gotten to know each other a little. I of course... Tend to ramble myself." Shape, now, returns
			a sigh. "I don't know much still. I only learned a bit more about your magic. I think that's okay. You know
			way more about me in comparison. Like the magic rune stones."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver makes a very low groan, and rubs her forehead with some fingers. "No, this isn't right. I'm
			incredibly stuck up and secretive about these details usually. Your magic, your... Rune stones... Did you do
			this? Did you make me talk?" She doesn't face Shape to ask this. It's less a direct accusation and more
			exploring of options she seems possible. Silver's arms cross over her stomach. She doesn't feel pleasant at
			all.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape frowns. She continues staring at her, whether or not she'll return a gaze, and she says with little
			charisma, "I'm many things, Silver, but a liar isn't one of them. I'm not doing shit to you... You wanted to
			see the rune stones, I wasn't going to show them to you and then you made me show them to you. That's on
			you. I didn't use them. And that's not how they work anyway. You'd have to agree to their effects if you
			were to be changed by any." She grabs her own knees, leaning forward. "I really just think we had a good
			time together. And I was open and so you felt you could be too. Is that so hard to believe? Friends sharing
			stuff about their lives. Trying to be friends."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver reaches out, to Shape's cheek. It's a soft gesture. "That's the problem. I don't believe things. I
			know things, or I don't know them. And if I don't know, I find out. Believing causes issues."
		<p>
			She quite firmly but not unkindly turns Shape's head to face her own meeting eyes, and there's a growing
			crackle of magic... But the only thing that comes out as the opens her mouth is a sudden sob. She lets go,
			wraps her arms around Shape instead, and leans her head awkwardly into her shoulder as she starts crying. "I
			promised..."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape felt a spike of her magic blood, a rush of warmth, when Silver's eyes came to meet her own. But it had
			nowhere, after all, to resist Silver's Silver Tongue. Alarmed, stiff, Shape places her hands on Silver's
			upper body, behind her shoulders, and rubs with her right hand in a slow, circular motion. She stammers, and
			then says, "I... I've been where you are. I've not trusted people. People have hurt me. You shouldn't feel
			forced to believe anything, but..." Shape's shoulders relax, and she sighs. "I didn't mean to make you
			cry..."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver shakes her head. "You didn't make me cry. I made myself cry. Maybe you're right... Maybe it was just
			a nice evening. Maybe I did feel like telling you these things. I wish it were easier to accept that. I've
			grown outright paranoid, haven't I? It feels like such a necessary, healthy concern usually but also usually
			it doesn't get in the way of? Proper friendship, I suppose? I've never met someone quite like you."
		<p>
			Silver teases a handkerchief out of her pocket and blows her nose in it before lying back on the bed and
			closing her eyes. There is not too much left of her general elegant nature, face marked by crying and her
			posture somewhat curled up in a wary and uncomfortable manner.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape watches Silver lie down and curl. She keeps trying to think of the right things to say... And she goes
			closer to the bed and covers Silver with a bit of blanket up to her shoulders, finally coming to words. "I
			wish people didn't lie, sometimes. You know there's a movie where the premise is that nobody's learned to
			lie? I know that couldn't be good, either, always telling the truth, but... It'd be better than this...
			putting such doubts in you. I've never met someone like you either... Wait right here, please." Shape
			escapes the bedroom, holding her head as she darts down the stairs. She prepares water and some oatmeal for
			Silver. She never felt so uncomfortable in her bedroom.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			She doesn't say much to this little monologue, simply letting Shape take her leave. The blanket is nice, and
			she settles in a bit more comfortably below it. Other people always being honest by nature would be very
			practical, but the idea of having to do the same herself would greatly outweigh that. Would she be capable
			of such? She's not sure. She's lived off secrets and misdirection. What if she could change that...? What if
			she could be in a position where she simply didn't need to lie any more? There are a few ways to achieve
			that, certainly. Of very different flavors of ethical and good. She lets her mind spiral a bit on this
			thought, it's better than being upset by the here and now.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape comes back into the room with a bowl of cinnamon apple oatmeal and a glass of water, although the
			oatmeal is of course the box kind with the flavored sugar packet. She places the oatmeal and fork atop of
			Silver and the blanket, and then she sits beside Silver on the bed, holding the glass. "This water is for
			you. I'll hold it so it doesn't spill." She stares at Silver's eyes, open or closed. She wants to show that
			trust-- treat thy neighbor like she wants to be treated, but especially if you make it obvious. "If there's
			anything else I can do for you, I will. Was thinking that... You deserve to see more evidence I'm on your
			side, I guess?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver carefully sits up, and takes the presented meal. She pries into it and has a small forkful. "Thank
			you... You're awfully kind to me. I suppose I've been missing out if having people be friendly and genuine
			is this good." She giggles halfheartedly. "It's not the same when you, ahem, encourage people to be this
			friendly. What do you mean, evidence? What do you have in mind?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			She smiles and pulls some of her own green hair back from her eyes. "It's no problem. I really think
			kindness, well placed, does anyone well... Oh, for evidence, I mean like..." She tilts her head back, and
			makes a silly mumbling noise. "I'll continue to be helpful and supportive and friendly. I know you
			manipulate people, but you're not just permanently cold or anything... Or, hell, maybe you'd need my help
			sometimes? In this uncaring world, I would definitely need yours too."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Her eyes fall onto the green hair, and she can't resist reaching out and running a hand through it. "Working
			together, helping each other, like a detective duo. Maybe we could solve come crime. It's a shame I can't as
			easily adapt the blue, I'm quite attached to the whole being silver thing I have going on." She pauses, has
			some more meal. "I wouldn't constitute that as evidence, personally, but as I've implied I'm quite peculiar
			about being certain of things... What manner of things would I be able to help with? You seem to get along
			well, in general. Though maybe my sample size is just small."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape glimmers. "God, that game was a lot of fun. We'll have to finish it some time. I'll take a picture of
			the board later so we remember what we were doing... But, I suspect, we could solve crime, yes. I wouldn't
			mind if you stayed Silver for that." She flushes. The light beams through the window blinds grow more obtuse
			in angle as the sun rises higher. "Well, we'll work on the evidence then I suppose. I think I'd want to
			level with you and find the happy medium... As for helping me, it's a bit embarrassing to admit, but there's
			a few groups of people that historically I've been at their whims and fancies. Specifically there's this
			organization that's almost a bit of a cult that's obsessed with magical beings, and they've tried to capture
			me a whole lot. I haven't seen them in a couple years, but the last time I saw them they were right here in
			the city. I don't want to constantly move away or become unrecognizable physically all the time, even if I
			have the power." She glances through the window. "They call themselves Apotheosis... Also maybe the
			government of Germany doesn't like me either but I'm getting ahead of myself."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver blinks, twice. "Um."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah," She says. "I was thinking that since you run a large operation that maybe you'd have some ability to
			influence figureheads of this group to leave me the hell alone. 'The one who calls themself Shape.' I swear
			that's the shit they've said about me... Or, yeah, I guess I could use help with some other stuff like the
			fact my bank account isn't doing so hot, but well, I shouldn't be asking for favors I should be getting I
			should be asking what favors I can do for you. Can't a person with as much magical expertise and experience,
			with physical shapeshifting ability, be of any use to you?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver looks down into her oatmeal. "If I didn't already have large interest in keeping my magics secret, I
			sure would now. There's fucking organizations that hunt magic people. I'd have my means to crush them if
			necessary, or at least severely hinder them. But. I already have enough issues to deal with." She puts the
			oatmeal aside. She's not hungry any more, and instead takes the glass of water. "Not to make our friendship
			or partnership too transactional, but... I could spare some money, no problem. People have tended to be more
			cooperative and reliable when I support them. Not saying I don't trust you without, but it'd probably put my
			mind more at ease for the time being."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape takes the oatmeal up from Silver's side, and nods. "Yeah, I agree that I don't want to make things
			about money. They're never really about money for me if I can avoid it. But, yeah, I guess it'd be putting
			my mind at ease too, and I'd certainly feel pretty cooperative if I wasn't already. We'll just play into
			that psychology, in other words." She hums, facing the bowl and twirling the fork inside. "There's so much
			about the magical world you have yet to learn, though, organizations like that just being another thing. I
			think you'd totally crush them, for the record. And I'd fucking smile about it." She faces Silver again.
			"Well. I'll text you the relevant bank info later. I guess.. Well, I'm an extrovert, but maybe you're more
			of an introvert. What did you want to do now?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			She can't help but smirk. Usually these subconscious effects of the mind are more secretive and one-sided,
			but as with many things involving Shape it's a whole other thing to do it openly and cooperatively. "That
			sounds like a plan, then. You'll have to figure out a roughly appropriate amount, I honestly am not good
			with things like reasonable, not-upper-class budgets. I'd probably give you an uncomfortably high amount if
			you made me choose."
		<p>
			Silver finally puts the blanket aside, and stands up. "Well, usually when I get this far into a morning
			waking up in someone else's bed, I've either left by now or the person is awfully infatuated with me and...
			Oh, you know. Having serious mornings that lead to actual togetherness is not my strong suit. I haven't even
			checked my messages and business matters yet today, I've completely forgotten."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah... I'll text you an amount later. It'll be extremely modest, don't worry. I've never really been rich
			and never needed to be. I guess I'd be buying fancy paintings like you if I had the money, I guess, and
			maybe also exotic food? But yeah. What is there for a person like me to purchase in luxury?" Shape shrugs
			and cozies partially into the blanket herself as Silver stands. "I feel pretty infatuated, but I wouldn't
			say awfully, no. I guess if you need to check on the messages and business stuff I have a laptop I could let
			you borrow, or you could always head back and we'll just hang out again sometime soon? I'll just be bored
			once you're gone, if you go, but I'll find something. It's been a real treat."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I appreciate the offer, but... I can do these things on my phone, and there's plenty of accounts and
			software involved that I'd rather not put on other people's devices. I do suppose I could need the time to
			relax and think anyhow, but it's been... An under the line positive experience being here, thank you. Do
			message or call if there is anything." She walks over to Shape's desk and puts down the water before putting
			her jacket on. She still feels rather scruffy from sleeping like this and mostly wants to go straight home
			so she can tend to this.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape rests her head back on the pillow, and she gazes at the corner of her eye at Silver. "Don't worry
			about locking the front door, I guess. Oh, and I will let you know if I need anything yeah. And maybe even
			want anything. I'm glad it's been positive, no problem." She covers part of her cheek in blanket and rolls
			on her side. "Hey, one more thing. You look great. Really good. And are intelligent." Maybe Shape will try
			to sleep another hour and a half.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver nods, and takes her depart. She stops by the living room, giving one last glance to the board game.
			She sighs, and leaves.
