        Shape's miniaturization depleted a couple of hours after they arrived to her home, returning her to normal
        height within the span of a few breaths. The hours had set in, however, and her cheery and even suave demeanor
        became shot. She thanked Silver for her help, and she helped her to the front door. The fox tails remained, but
        Silver insisted she had no concern. She wanted to return to her mansion.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Shape now sits at her laptop into the late evening, the stylish outfit Silver designed for her folded aside,
        flicking through webpages for something to fulfill his promise to Silver. Magical artifacts and individuals
        exist anywhere you have a hunch—less common are ones that are safe enough and yet interesting enough to probably
        catch Silver's attention. One of the local lakes has a promising candidate, however, according to a collector's
        account.

    <div class="wrap Azu_w">
      <p>
        Silver is happy to be home, and most importantly out of any public eye with her striking appearance. She
        carefully offloads the potions in a cabinet where Nina won't be expected to brush through the next day, and
        settles down. While the tails have started growing on her in a more metaphorical sense, she still finds them
        oddly awkward while seated. It ends up being an evening of being mostly bare draped across the sofa, and
        watching whatever catches her attention on the television. The lingering phantom sensations of fur sweeping
        across her legs makes her not even realize the exact time the tails faded away. If nothing else, she's glad the
        process was subtle enough to not distract from watching a documentary on organized crime. She'll sleep heavily
        tonight. It felt a very long day despite them returning home in a very timely manner.
      </p>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>--------------------</p>

      <p>
        "We're going to be outside pretty much the whole time this time, Silver, if where I was told to scout it is
        true. I hope that's fine. But trust me, I think you'll find this next, uh, magic thingy well worth your time.
        It's an amulet, actually."
      </p>

      <p>
        Shape turns the monitor on the kitchen table toward Silver. A few documents are overlaid atop one another and,
        beside these, a road map and a sketch of the amulet are open. The artistic render of the amulet is
        unassuming—it's an opaque white gem in the form of a teardrop inset to a thin metal circle, draping of course
        from a tightly-wound string.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Apparently it can have a whole swarm of birds at your bidding. I do wonder what kind of obtuse enchanting
        rituals the native people did with this thing, but it worked, I guess. So, what do you think? And do you think
        I'll look good in like a sunhat? Outfit number two seems in order."
      </p>

      <p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Azu_w">
      <p>
        The latter part of Shape's comments goes right past Silver's attention as she absorbs the amassed information
        that Shape has on her screen. There's a fascination in her eyes. "Birds? I will admit... I have on a few
        occasions seen if I can affect animals or the like. But the language barrier does mean I can't get through to
        them. I am very curious how this must be like - doing what I already know but in a different way." She leans in
        close to get a good look of the sketch and read some of the finer text on the screen.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Yeah, I used to shapeshift into animals sometimes, and interestingly that didn't really give me an advantage
        with communicating with them either. I'd imagine that's because my mind is still human, like how you have that
        language barrier with your abilities too, when it comes down to it. Maybe this amulet doesn't let you talk to
        birds though. Maybe it's more like making them like you, or playing them like an orchestra conductor, or
        something like that?"
      </p>

      <p>
        She shrugs, and she checks if she has the coordinates ready on her phone. And the phone's battery, for that
        matter. It should last long enough.
      </p>

      <p>"Anyway—sunhat? What do you think?"</p>

      <p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Azu_w">
      <p>
        Silver finally dignifies the question, since Shape insists. Her eyes shift off the screen and at her companion.
        Sizing up, projecting ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hmm. It's a neat idea, but don't go for one of the boring ones. You should try a red band on it, make it pop."
      </p>

      <p>
        And then Silver distracts herself again, returning to both the notes on screen and her reflection in the monitor
        at the same time. Her hair flows weirdly this morning. She doesn't like it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Red, now that's a color I could go for... I said it before but you really do have a talent in this. What goes
        well with a sunhat, again, though? Probably something light? Probably even lighter than last time."
      </p>

      <p>She'll gladly keep Silver hostage anytime they assemble a new piece in this wardrobe.</p>

      <p>--------------------</p>

      <p>"It's kinda bigger than I expected."</p>

      <p>
        Shape leans on the passenger side door of his orange car parked on the grass. The light fog obscures whatever
        may be beyond this mile of the lake's gently rippling surface. And some sparse trees and shrubs line the rocky
        sand and the water.
      </p>

      <p>"I think we should rent a canoe, unless you'd like to take a dip. I have no problem with it, but, yeah."</p>
    </div>

      More soon.
