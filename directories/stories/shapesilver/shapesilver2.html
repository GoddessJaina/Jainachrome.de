			The walk is only about twenty minutes, and Shape opens the door for them and closes it behind them. "So,
			right, I take it you're not much for television. What sort of thing would you like to do, maybe? I have,
			like, cards. I forgot how to play solitaire and stuff though. Even though I have a lot of free time, I guess
			I haven't had it with a guest in a while, so yeah." He rubs his own neck and sits on the couch in the living
			room. By now one of the arms of it slump. "I wonder, Silver, have you always been kinda affluent? Or was it
			more of a new money thing rather than an old money thing? I thought about maybe starting a business. Not
			really sure how you'd approach that."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver takes seat not far from Shape on the couch. The suggestions for entertainment are mostly ignored, for
			now. "Quite a... cozy little place you have here, Shape dear. As for my financial situation, it's a rather
			long story. It's not a very recent development but it's all my own efforts. No inheritance or the likes. The
			gifts my existence has blessed me with are of other kinds, and I simply apply those well. I won't bore you
			with the details of it all though." She quickly deflects the topic once she's satisfied with her answer.
			"What manner of business is on your mind?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			"I mean, I would hardly be bored, Silver. I think you know that." Shape shrugs. Gifts blessed with "of other
			kinds?" She's probably hiding some weird shit. Could be cult, could be royalty, maybe simply magic. "Yeah, I
			like my place too. I've had it for like 12 years now. I guess the business I was thinking of would be
			reselling stuff I get from vendors of some sort. Or maybe I can make a product. I know a lot of people do
			stuff like soap, but maybe I could make my own tea, I guess? I like tea; I have a pretty modest collection
			of tea bags even. I could see that being a rewarding practice to ship those." He takes off his shoes and
			lies across the couch, dangling his feet off the side to give Silver space.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver knows this, yes, but she's really not keen on delving into the details. Way too many cans of worms
			that should remain unopened. "That's... Fairly loose an idea, I can't really give advice if you yourself
			don't know what you're aiming for. Tea, you say? I didn't quite read you as a considerable tea-knower but I
			do like to be surprised. Do you have faith in being able to handle that?" She doesn't feel infringed in
			space by Shape taking up most of the sofa, giving a look down at him. "You seem awfully comfortable around
			strangers, or at least with me. Are you experienced with new people?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			"I have faith that I might be able to learn. I guess motivation is hard to keep straight for me more so than
			just being... you know, capable," He admits. He looks up to her, and hums before saying, "Uh, yep. I have
			met plenty of people in my time, plenty pretty exotic as well. It's always a pleasure to meet new people.
			You've been one yourself. A very refined and classy woman. With mysterious gifts, apparently." If only his
			retention rate with new people was higher. Somehow, he's managed to make sure he has sex and awkward
			departures more often than not. He pushes the comment, murmuring, "I might have those too. They're also
			pretty irrelevant."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			The atmosphere seems to freeze up around Silver. The conversation took a turn she had not at all expected
			and was seemingly quite uncomfortable with. The idea that Shape was more than just a commoner and also
			caught onto her loose descriptions with such ease? Meant that in some way, shape or form, he could pose a
			threat to her doings. Or maybe he knew people, or otherwise beings, that might.
		<p>
			She takes two deep breaths, stares down at him quite sharply despite putting on a friendly face, and
			whispers. "Oh, they might be very relevant. Please, tell me about them."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape comes to regret staring back at her. Her presence is immediately made alien from warm and elegant, and
			Shape is very compelled to delve on information he definitely didn't want to just mention, at least so
			lamely as it were. He's definitely been this loose before, but, really, it could wait-- "I'm a shapeshifter.
			As in, I can turn into different people. Kind of a party trick and lifestyle choice more than anything..."
			He says, and sucks his lips in after, for a moment. He sits up in his seat, and runs behind the coach to
			toward the kitchen, and he says aloud, "Okay, what the fuck, Silver? What was that shit? Are you a witch?
			Maybe you're one of those nymphs of the woods or something... I'd rather say things at my own pace, please?
			I really would."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver is almost as startled as Shape is; not only did she lay on her powers far too thick, but she didn't
			even consider that obviously he would have some form of experience. She puts her face in her hands and makes
			a rather uncharacteristic groaning sound. "I am.... I am very sorry about that." She doesn't care to address
			the information she extracted just yet. "It's all quite complicated. I did not take you to be something more
			than common, and I, well. I panicked a bit when you mentioned you were. I have little experience with...
			Other unnatural people, I suppose."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape pours himself water in the kitchen, glancing at his spear he last left beside the fridge. “Yeah, all
			right. Whatever lady. Sorry I'm a bit pissed BUT I think you'd understand if you do this often that this
			isn't... It's not kosher, yeah? It kind of is invasive and shit.” He sips his drink, spilling a bit on his
			collar. “Okay, well you know now I'm not 'common,' for sure. Don't call me unnatural. Anyway, would like you
			something to drink too or do we need to, like, start over maybe really.” It's not really phrased like a
			question, but the part of it that's a request is unclear.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"No, no, you're very right. That was entirely uncalled for. And... I was more referring to myself, not you,
			but apologies for that as well." It's clear that Silver is just as much unnerved by the entire situation,
			fidgeting to focus her stress away and speaking slowly as her usually refined tone and words don't fall to
			her nearly as easily now. "Let me make you an offer. You're free to ask any questions, though I may turn
			some of them down. I won't influence you again, so we can have a proper conversation tonight. But I'll have
			to politely ask you keep everything about my... different nature to yourself. This place is cozy." She
			sighs. "And it'd be a shame to have to vanish again so soon. I really, really don't want to cause any
			issues." She looks at him, but quickly turns away again as there are still lingering magic in the air
			between them as the eyes meet. The difference between her earlier confident and elegant stature, and now,
			seems to deepen with each moment.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“I'll just get you some water. I don't really feel like offering wine... It's okay, I guess. Just okay.”
			Shape grabs his spear beside the fridge, after some deliberation, and leaves it hidden from Silver's view by
			leaning it behind the wall just beside the counter you'd clip the corner of entering the kitchen. He walks
			over to hand Silver her drink, and then he walks back to beside the counter seemingly just to grab his, but
			he doesn't join her back in the living room. He continues, “I wouldn't even have anyone to talk about your
			powers to.” Except, what, Vera. “Sure, I guess I'll ask some questions. I also enjoy your company, with a
			bit of caution. So uh... Okay, here's something, did you even want to be my friend? Was all that earlier
			about the art stalls just buying time for this? I really liked the necklace, you know.” He rubs his own
			shoulder.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver takes it off his hands most carefully, taking care not to touch him in any way in the process. People
			have tended to fear that when knowing, even though it has no bearings on her power. "From my understanding
			of your lil' Miss Blogger friend, I would very much not have someone who likes to write and share
			information so eagerly know. So that is not awfully reassuring." She takes a few slow sips of the water and
			then rotates the glass idly in her hands. "My efforts were genuine, I promise. You'd be correct, when I'm
			out and about there's surely also on my mind the chance I find people who would be a considerable benefit to
			have influence over. I bet anyone in my position would. But I do also actually seek company. It gets so
			awfully lonely whenever I need to find a new place to reside in. Genuine company is so much harder to
			achieve than most things in life. Please... I did really mean well with all these things. I took a liking to
			you from the very start."
		<p>
			She sighs, deeply. It's such a strain, being so open about herself. She's not feeling well at all, and she
			looks the part. But she wants to make things good again, somehow.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape sighs, following hers. He drinks as well, and says, “I think you're a bit reserved of a person. I
			think I was maybe more like that when I was younger. I'm not some 20 year old, after all. I've changed a
			lot. Just know I guess that even though we might have great powers of manipulation that maybe, yeah, it's
			not nice to do that, I guess. Hmm.” He taps his bare feet on the lining between living room rug and kitchen
			tile. “Yeah, I had so much time and I still can't hold a friend too long, my oldest ones have already left
			for greater things... I tell you what I'd do if I had that power, I'd use it to make friends. And steal
			money from rich people. Which I guess is what shapeshifting is also like, in theory.” He leaves his glass at
			the counter, and he walks closer to Silver, avoiding her gaze. “Oh, Vera? She's actually a bit of a softy, I
			swear, and I don't really have interest in telling her about this. She wouldn't shut up about this, or
			anything that happens. Even I find that annoying. Although she seemed distracted today, anyway, so.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I should have guessed, I suppose. Shapeshifting seems very practical to retain an impression of youth. I've
			instead tried my best to simply grow my manners along with my age, maybe." She falls silent a bit.
			Reflecting on her own relative youth. Man, how times have changed. "I've tried using my powers to make
			friends, in some ways. It feels... Hollow, in the end. Whether they falsely believe I'm a lifelong friend
			already, or they are fascinated by my power and are attached to that more than me. Keeping my powers and the
			people I have affected separate from my actual social relations has become a given over time." She doesn't
			comment on the money part, but there's a most subtle smile when Shape mentions Vera.
		<p>
			"Greater things? I'd be curious but I won't pry. Talking about people of the past rarely ever makes me
			happy." She rubs the back of her neck awkwardly. "And, well. There's a lot of them for me."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			This about Silver's failed attempts to have powers involved in her social life tickles Shape. Of course it
			wouldn't work, it couldn't. In the end, it's a cheap party trick, same as Shape's, surely, or hard
			manipulation. He felt strange to have even suggested the idea now. He's been there...
		<p>
			He sits on the couch, away from Silver, with his head back and his eyes closed. He says, “Greater things in
			this case I just mean like... Going to some island with an ocarina, or returning to a cave to maintain a
			forest, or even just trying to fuck some chick named Rose. Hell, Vera's barely around herself. Workaholic,
			kind of not interested... It sounds like people in your past were manipulated, of course, yeah. But hey,
			maybe not this time?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"Heh. Congratulations to Rose, I suppose." Silver was still seated facing the direction Shape had been
			sitting earlier, but turns away from them as he's seated there again and instead observes the rest of the
			room idly. "I've had a few or other genuine ones. Nothing impressive. I suppose I'm not the best at just
			being a person around people." She sighs. "People are complicated. It's so easy to simplify them if needed,
			but that's not always right for me, even in the selfish assessment of things."
		<p>
			"I hope I'm not making myself seem entirely unpleasant or such with this. It's not often I start reflecting
			too deeply? I..." She stops for some time. "I'm very uncomfortable right now. But that's all my fault.
			Mostly because I choose to not take the easy way out of using my powers to solver everything... Because I
			like you just a bit too much, it seems."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“I didn't say Rose actually wanted to have sex with him.” He laughs, and folds his hands together. “Hmm,
			I've had some experiences with people's minds being changed, but yeah, again it just always seemed more like
			a sexy thing than a strategic one. What are you trying to get out of people anyway? Money kinda? Importance?
			I have to admit that I'm not the most comfortable I've ever felt, but I at least feel I'm not underhanded,
			and I really did like our time together too. So, yeah, let's just let this be a bit awkward, Silver... Are
			you hungry? Perhaps you'd like food before you go.” Trying to court Silver to the bed, unlike most people
			Shape met, seemed poor. Even if she was a nice day to be with. “Oh, uh, and my phone number in any case.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"It's... a complicated question. But as you might suppose, my wealth isn't off the back of purely human
			efforts. I haven't destroyed anyone's livelihood to achieve it, of course. It's easy to strike lopsided
			deals with people when they think it's not the case, and then make the traces disappear later.
			Businesspeople are all part of a large game, and I simply bend the rules. Such are the risks of the system."
			She seems pleased with this justification, and ends her tangent there. "Importance is sketchy, if earned
			dishonestly. And you may notice that I try to keep my importance on the down low. The more people perceive
			me, the... The harder it is to stay in control."
		<p>
			"Thank you for... For your trust and patience, though. I'd have understood if you kicked me out or such
			earlier, though it'd surely have complicated matters for me. I think exchanging phone numbers is good, yeah.
			Feel free to give me a call if there is anything at all." She produces a small notepad and a silver pen out
			of one of her inner pockets, and quickly scribbles her number on it, tearing off the page and placing it
			down on the sofa in Shape's direction. "It might be a better option than talking to others about me, I
			suppose... Oh, I probably am supposed to eat something. I do not quite feel like it, but needs are needs."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape glowers, somewhat, partway through the monologue. He... folds his legs together and sighs, and then
			opens his eyes once more to search for the note and then input it into his phone in his pants pocket. He
			leaves a text, which is an emote of a wave. He says, “I try to be patient, yeah. Let's keep in touch.
			Although, regarding dinner, I kind of don't have anything good to eat, I guess... And I'm pretty tired. Hmm.
			If you don't feel like eating too I guess you don't always have to.” So her wealth was hard earned, probably
			an entire lifetime of manipulation. This was much worse than just a tendency to want more friends or show
			off, or even covering for herself, this was like an entire operation. It was... morbid. Dirty money, and who
			knows if it was all wrapped up with lies still, maybe she destroyed lives, maybe she continues to want to
			manipulate, well, him... If Vera knew about this, she'd snuff this woman's entire operation, but Shape
			wasn't going to bother. Really convenient that Vera didn't press further. Really. “Reputation is everything,
			sure... I have no intentions to bother your business, I want to remind you. All we're going to be is two
			people who know each other and hang out sometimes, yeah...”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"And I won't bother you with it, don't worry." She sips again at her still more than half full glass. He
			seems upset. More than ideal. And she doesn't understand. She takes out the phone to see the message, and
			makes a half-hearted giggle at the wave emoji before saving the number. "I... Yeah, I do hope we can manage
			that, maybe. It would be nice. You are nice."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“Yeah. So. I'll have some more time to think about all this, but, yeah, I hope we could manage that. I think
			that would be. Lovely. After all... ” Shape stands up, and walks behind Silver, towering over her. “You're
			young, beautiful, and have a lot of money, at the least. It's okay if you don't want the rest of your water
			before you have to go for now.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver sets aside the glass almost as if on command. Shape is right; she should leave. "Young, you say?
			Sometimes I feel like time is the one thing that escapes me the most. It can't be convinced the way I would
			so many other things... At least, I haven't found a way to do so yet." She doesn't have anything to pack up,
			so she simply stands up and turns to Shape. Averting her eyes, instead focusing on a rather arbitrary spot
			on the back of the sofa. "As I said, I'll be doing my best to move into a residence to the west. You have my
			phone number, if there is anything." She sighs, considers a handshake but again decides that skin contact is
			maybe not something she should be inviting right now. It could scare him. "I don't feel like I'm in a
			position to ask for much but again, I prefer these details about me don't get too much traction. Take care,
			and do rest well."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“I'd say young, yeah. And, yeah, it's difficult to emulate real life experience going back far unless you
			have a most potent form of magic. So that makes sense.” He leans against the sofa behind where Silver was
			sitting prior. And he nods when she looks away from his eyes. “I'll call you. Thank you again for the yellow
			necklace. I'll wear it next time. Maybe I'll go to your place? Surely it's only the most opulent setting?”
			He almost snickers. He takes the glass from her hands gently. “I won't spread this info, no. I thought about
			it, and no. We'll just keep it between us. Goodnight as well.” He walks with Silver to the door, holding her
			arm. He sips from her glass of water. And he closes the door after she's inspired to walk away a few feet.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			As soon as she's out of the view from him, she takes to leaning against a streetlight for a bit. Sigh. That
			was much more of a situation than she'd anticipated, and she still needs to arrange her new living space.
			Hopefully sooner now that she's already expecting a visitor. An interior designer would be in order; she's
			not in the mood to arrange things herself any more. At least to start.
		<p>
			She begins the slow trod back to her hotel, her path following the exact one the two took earlier today.
			It's much more empty, more lonely now that it's late and she's by herself, and she has lost that light and
			secure feeling of being new and unknown to a place already.
