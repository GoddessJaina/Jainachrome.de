	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			The
			space is like a combination of an office and a drug store, with homely interior decoration and some glassy
			displays of
			different vials and flasks, many of which labelled. Shape explains to Jae-eun the partial truth, and she
			props
			herself
			against the wall in a flattering posture. And the orange fox woman is sat in a padded chair with
			ever-present
			tail
			flicking and claws showing.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver observes the exchange at first, with just slight agreements and nodding to back up Shape's tale. And
			she
			takes a
			position somewhat between the two, just to avoid the worst happening too soon. "Pleased to meet you,
			Jae-eun."
			The fox
			definitely has seen some years since the pictures on the outside of the store were taken, Silver notes.
			"I've
			been
			trying to delve into the prospects that harnessing magic can offer, and I promise, it can be very lucrative
			for
			us both
			if something you can offer appeals to my needs. So, I'd be curious to see what surprises your range of vials
			may
			hold."
			Her eyes gaze over the flasks with a fascination - She'd intended to play it up a bit but there's no need
			for
			that. It's
			truly something to for her take in, knowing that there is magic lined up in these displays. Waiting to be
			explored.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			Jae-eun tries to walk beside Silver for a direct line at Shape, and she says, "You're always getting up on
			my
			shit!
			First you made yourself a copy of me and now you're doing business too? Whatever, look, you don't have the
			same
			sort of
			reputation I do—and fine, it's not magic goods according to you. I'm just..." She digs her nails into her
			seat,
			and
			she stuffs out a growl. Then, she smiles to Silver. "Sorry, I'm really pleased to meet you too, Shape said
			you
			are
			called Silver? Kind of on the nose, but I like it! I'll show you everything I've got, especially my best and
			most
			popular products. Umm, right, so—" Jae-eun collects a number of potions from the main display case and some
			select
			potions from the side cabinet. It eats into a considerable chunk of the whole collection, and leaves Shape
			and
			Silver
			with more potions than they could possibly want to sort through today, at least thirty. "Lot of variety!
			That's
			what the
			consumers like. It sounds like you want something practical?" She points to a blue, foggy, round potion.
			"This
			makes you
			very light. And this other one makes you much louder."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape sighs and slumps into a seat close to the wall. She puts her hand over her mouth for several seconds,
			and
			then she
			uncovers it long enough to say, "You think you could be more specific? My partner in business really doesn't
			have time
			for these games. She wants the little print." She flutters her eyelashes.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver gazes from Jae-eun, to Shape, and back. Those two really don't get along, more so than expected and
			very
			mutually
			so. She sighs in a purposefully notable way, and then allows a more purposeful discussion to occur once the
			two
			have
			settled for now. "It's on the nose indeed, I know. Than you." She watches the foxette assemble the wares,
			and
			allows
			herself to take one of the more sturdy looking flasks to observe. "Lighter, you say? I'd have to figure out
			the
			specifics of that but it does sound possibly useful in given situations a long as it doesn't make you
			awkwardly
			drift
			about." She gives a glance to the potion that affects the voice, and frowns. That's something she's really
			not
			too eager
			to mess with, even if amplifying her Tongue could have very potent outcomes. "Shape. Don't be too quippy.
			You're
			right
			though, I do want details. How many servings go in a typical vial, for example?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			She sighs, and she gently swishes a tall, dark potion. "All right, details then. Every potion has a label,
			and
			they're
			not all the same information listed but they all say a serving amount! It varies a lot for these potions so
			like
			the
			blue lighten one is, yeah, hold on." She picks off from an unrelated drawer a pair of glasses, and she holds
			the
			flask
			to her face. "100 milliliters. You could look it up online if you want like the cups amount. But yeah, you
			could
			use
			this one potion at least like five or six times or something? That's high value! This other one with the
			loudness is
			actually a bit more expensive, I remember." She reads off that clear liquid container, too. "Yeah. Half
			bottle,
			but it
			goes down real easy. It's like drinking a mint cucumber. Um, got other questions, Silver?" She sits back in
			her
			leather
			chair and smirks at Shape. "It's really sweet you put up with that gremlin."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"Five or six times is a good number. Good way to be certain of the effect and then still have more left
			over. Is
			there
			anything here that's good for a demonstration? I won't request a freebie, of course." She reaches into her
			pocket and
			pulls out a greatly excessive amount of paper money since she isn't really aware the ranges these things
			cost.
			Given her
			presumed customer base of people who fall for her popstar branding it can't be too absurdly pricy though.
		<p>
			Silver picks up a vial, which mysteriously claims that it 'makes life less of an uphill battle'. She raises
			an
			eyebrow
			at it, and then holds it out to Shape. "I wonder if you find good use out of this one."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, many are! Just like avoid anything bad in the store unless you're outside and maybe also like far away?
			Like
			definitely not the volume one." The fox woman giggles and drags with both of her arms the large sum of money
			to
			her far
			end of the potion display. "I will offer a very, very fair bargain for you! Any samples you want dear! And,
			if
			you don't
			mind, I think Shape would make a lovely candidate for these." She, incessantly, giggles.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape folds her arms and scoots flatter against the back of the seat. "No, now, wait a minute, when did I
			agree
			to this?
			You didn't mean it like Jae-eun did right, I don't have to drink it? Because I think we could probably just
			have
			you
			drink it later—or maybe Jae-eun I guess, if we want to flip the script with this sample." She seems anxious,
			somehow,
			for the prospect of having a potion sample. Shape has been exposed to hundreds of these and probably drank
			more
			than a
			dozen and is quite magically resistant and knowledgeable anyway—yet, her skin looks ready to crawl out from
			under the
			door.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I came here to do research, Shape. Buying everything just in case it proves useful sounds very impractical.
			Sampling
			wares I assumed was a given, doing it here and now does much more use than doing it later. Do remember how
			much
			work I
			already put into this." Her eyes fall up and down over Shape's outfit. "I'd very appreciate it - Though you
			do
			make a
			point. As a confident saleswoman, Jae-eun, how eager are you to present any of the effects? You get the
			money,
			and you
			get to keep your wares. In some manner, at least." She chuckles and then gives a pretty firm look to assert
			that
			she's
			not entirely joking. Awaiting an answer, she picks up some more flasks. 'Add some more beauty and softness
			to
			your
			life!' Curious.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape bites her lip and takes the vial of yellow liquid. It smells fruity. She reads the label in closer
			detail,
			in
			particular the age and the name once more. "Y-You have put a lot of time into today, a lot of work, as per
			our
			agreement... I-I'll tell you about it later, but Silver, please understand what I'm about to do is kinda,
			yeah,
			I'm
			doing you a big favor. Potions and I go back is all. I want to sample the one about being lighter though, I
			think that's
			much less ominous, this one feels like a proverb." She says flatly, "No offense, Jae-eun."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			Jae-eun hums to herself watching Silver pin Shape to the task of sampling. And, having learned from previous
			mistakes in
			marketing her own interest in the potions, she tells Silver, "While I'd be quite confident to show you one
			of
			these
			effects, I can't alter my physical or emotional self while on the clock! And, besides, I think you're more
			familiar with
			your shapeshifting buddy's criticisms... Which, by the way, none taken, really. I don't make these ones I'm
			showing you,
			these are really nice ones I redistribute! Oh, and I did get that one custom distributed out to me, Silver,
			I
			take it
			you don't like surprises but do you like fluffy tails?" She raises most of her own and creeps them around
			her
			sides.
			They're poofy and brightly-colored.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver takes note of the various comments with various degree of concern. So, Shape has an odd aversion to
			potions and
			Jae-eun barely proves any confidence at all in the brews. Fluffy tail, though? Jae-eun seems certain enough
			of
			this one
			so if she's going to try anything today, might as well be something that's probably not intrusive at all.
			Silver
			allows
			herself to pluck a glass from a shelf and pour a dose for herself as mentioned. She brings a second glass
			too,
			passing
			it Shape's way. "I'll have to see how I feel about them... Oh, actually. Would it be one, or (one, two,
			three...) seven
			of them?" She counts visibly as the tails try to flick about and ruin her order. She misses one, of course.
			"That seems
			like a large number."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			"Eight tails! One for each, um, tail that I have. You'd look fabulous with them, I definitely recommend you
			try
			that
			one." She folds her right leg over her left and she adjusts her chair to face Silver the client. Long due.
			"A
			potion for
			fans of mine and fans of kitsunes in general, but also excellent for those curious about experimenting or
			expressing
			different flavors of species."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape trades the yellow vial out for the rotund sky blue one, pouring into her glass a careful portion as
			marked
			on the
			label like a ruler. "Yeah, apparently you can go a bit of a heavier dose. I'd rather not do that. Last thing
			I
			want is
			to be floating on the ceiling." Shape points out the ceiling fan, and she holds onto her staff as she
			presses
			the drink
			to her lips. "I don't see any use in holding off, I guess. So here goes nothing?" She intakes it in one
			broad
			and full
			sip. "God, what if this makes me like lighter psychologically somehow. I'm not even sure what'd mean? Or,
			well,
			I guess
			there's other ways you could be light right, if we're going by evil genie logic..."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver holds off on her own drink, just in case something goes wrong with them both it'd be a really bad
			idea to
			do them
			at the same time. She puts her glass down, and watches Shape curiously. Awaiting any reaction. "A heavier
			dose,
			you say?
			That seems... Counterproductive. Hehe." Her laughter is, of course, not fully hearted, the anticipation
			nagging
			a bit-
			"Something looks off about you." Silver hasn't yet noticed that her eyes have shifted slightly downward to
			keep
			even
			with Shape's.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Wow, that's pretty good. Bit of a, yep, oxymoron... I do agree though, something's definitely happening, I
			feel
			really
			weird, and I'm pretty sure it's like, well..." Shape uncomfortably shifts around in her seat, unable to find
			the
			groove
			from before, and it comes to a brief shock that her staff's radius has widened in her grip. Moreover, the
			room,
			including Silver and Jae-eun, seems larger. She groans. "Speaking of funny jokes, I'm clearly shrinking.
			Fuck."
			She
			touches her own face and outfit as time lapses and the transformation accelerates quickly until a sudden
			tapering. And
			she's left with her usual figure and the scaled height of, what, a baby? "I look like a fucking fairy.
			Weird. I
			guess it
			could have been worse, but I have no idea how I'm driving us home you know, assuming this will take a while
			to
			wear off.
			Jae-eun, you know, you could at least research what some of your freaking potions do."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			Jae-eun's eyes narrow. She stands and stretches out her claws. "Woah, Shape's adorable like that." She
			snickers.
			"I was
			just kidding when I called you a gremlin. You should really give it up. The potion works though, as you can
			see,
			Silver.
			Shape's very light now! Perhaps we should pick her up? I bet she'd enjoy that. She likes getting in people's
			hands.
			Always have."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver reaches out and takes the staff when Shape seems too small to effectively hold it any more, leaning
			it
			against
			the side of the chair instead. It's certainly an odd view to see such an itty bitty person, let alone a
			friend
			of hers.
			"I do have a license, Shape, so we shouldn't be in too much trouble with that." She does kneel down next to
			Shape's
			chair, observing. "Well, you seem to have settled in so I assume that's the height you're settled at until
			things wear
			off. And weight, yes. You certainly would be light enough for me to pick up like this." She shoots Jae-eun a
			bit
			of a
			harsh look. "This is still a sales pitch. Be nice, maybe... Oh, and I suppose it'd be a bad move of me to
			slink
			out of
			my part seeing as you already committed, Shape." She takes the filled glass of potion, and downs it too.
			It's...
			surprisingly fuzzy in texture, for a clear and smooth liquid.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape curls her knees up and then wraps her arms over them. She reaches out for the staff at her side and
			sighs,
			only
			grazing it. "Well, Silver, if this fox gets any ideas, with that cocky smile of hers, you know what to do. I
			mean it.
			And, yeah, I guess you'll just be driving me the way back. Uh, yeah, I guess I hope you don't mind holding
			me
			later
			because I'm not going to be able to get out of here without at least a bit of assistance." Shape's eyes
			roll.
			"Thanks
			for drinking the potion, though. It'll be interesting to see you with tails, anyway."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			"Ah, you remind me Shape, you totally have a thing for us foxgirls. I bet Silver didn't know that, but
			that's
			all right.
			She can think about that while her tails grow out." Jae-eun had nodded at the term "sales pitch," and she
			still
			slumps
			into her mockery. "Uhm, Silver, I think you could run to the bathroom? Just for a moment." Indeed, Silver's
			dressy pants
			are filling with excessive, fluffy tails like a balloon. Thankfully, a lot of the tails creep down her legs,
			some even
			peaking at her feet, silvery and white.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver sighs, and shifts uncomfortably. It doesn't help that the tails do have sensory response to them and
			don't seem
			very happy like this. She slinks through the closest doorway that isn't out, and as soon as she's around the
			corner she
			attempts to bring some order to this mess and at least have all the tails pop out the top of her pants.
			"Some
			things are
			just too obvious in hindsight, aren't they? I'll have to tailor something custom of this ever comes up again
			in
			the
			future."
		<p>
			A minute or two passes and she carefully comes back around, pants set a bit lower than before but not
			unsightly
			so. A
			set of eight tails wave around a bit aimlessly, one almost pulling a framed picture off a shelf. "So... I
			think
			one or
			two would have been preferable. There's a lot to take in here, this will definitely take some practice to
			understand. At
			least they're pretty." She takes one to hold and seems slightly startled again by the sensory feedback of it
			as
			she
			inspects the fluff.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape says, almost interrupting Silver, "Jae-eun's full of shit by the way, she just says that I like
			foxgirls
			because I
			once was a foxgirl, a copy of her, and suddenly she gets the bright idea that I'm just doing it because I'm
			horny, never
			mind any other reason someone would turn into a copy of a person. I don't know, no reason like needing to
			communicate
			with their friends, wanting to feel welcome in an uncaring world, wanting a fucking reason to use their
			innate
			powers?
			Please just get over it Jae-eun, you're embarrassing yourself more than you're embarrassing me. Seriously."
			She
			frowns
			at Jae-eun and then collects a deep breath back at Silver's many tails. She says, "Yeah, a version with less
			tails maybe
			for the future. They are pretty though—right about that."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			Jae-eun backs up to her side of the room when Silver enters the room. She shakes her head and starts sorting
			out
			some of
			the cash pile into proper stacks. She removes a purchasing guide, price complete, and slaps it on the
			display
			top. "I'm
			just going to ignore her, Silver. I really just want to work with you... Okay, so, if you look here we can
			work
			out a
			how many items and what items you want to purchase, and here's my number as well. Would it be all right if I
			had
			your
			contact as well? My clients are all important to me, and if anything comes up I'd like to be able to ring
			you.
			Whether
			that be special offers or pertinent information about a product. Yeah." Jae-eun takes her phone from nearby
			after a
			buzz, and she dismisses it upon reading the screen. "I'd love to learn more about your business, Silver.
			Maybe
			we could
			have some ties?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver takes a little while just to be able to sit down in the chair, once all the tails cooperate and she
			won't
			sit on
			one of them. They slink around as if on their own conscious, sort of like a pile of fuzzy Medusa snakes. "I
			will
			be
			entirely honest and say that my hopes for this all were a bit higher, there seems to be a large degree of
			unpredictability in some of the supposed effects. I will, for starters, at least take two or three of the
			two
			potions
			sampled though. Being small is a versatile ability, at least if I find you can scale it with amount consumed
			and...
			Maybe one day I'll have a need to mimic a mythical creature for whatever benefit." She pulls out a calling
			card
			and
			slides it over the table, taking Jae-eun's number in return. "I'll need this at the very least for if
			there's
			complications with... My accomplice remaining small for whatever reason. As for my business? I have a lot of
			irons in
			various fires, it's not something awfully specific. I'll see if anything comes up, you're always free to
			pitch
			me some
			of your brews... If you're actually confident in what they do." Silver doesn't pay that much mind to Shape
			either, but
			does take notes of the apparent backstory that seems to connect and yet divide these two.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			"It's a fair concern for someone like you Silver, and maybe other people should be concerned about it. But I
			notice a
			lot of people aren't interested in the details! I think a lot of them are just looking to experience wacky
			things? I
			guess if it mattered more to the distributors that sell to me, uhm, why would they label it like this? Oh
			but no
			matter,
			I'll assume three of the shrinking one and two of the tail one. Anything else for this purchase?" Jae-eun
			saves
			Silver's
			number on her cellular, and she nods. She walks over to particularly large drawer under yet another of the
			displays, and
			she pulls out a carton one might use for beer bottles. "I promise there won't be complications, however.
			Well—okay,
			there is the general stipulation us potion sellers like to give that if you mix magic you might find
			unintended
			results!
			Like, have you ever mixed a wine spritzer and an energy drink? Me neither... Ah, yeah, I'll make sure to
			pitch
			you more
			of the brews as they come in, maybe some other ones here too. Excellent idea, Silver." She passes on the
			stocked
			carton
			and change to her client.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver glances at the carton, then at Shape, then back. "I do have an amount of arms and a lot of things to
			carry, it
			seems. I'm glad you parked nearby, Shape, I might take you out first. I'd do the potions first but I think
			you
			appreciate not being left alone with Jae-eun for the time being." The leftover paper money silver carefully
			orders again
			before tucking it away where it originally came from. "I'll try to keep it in mind about mixing magic,
			considering
			predictability is pretty important to me-" She breaks off slightly too quick, realizing she may have implied
			her
			own
			magic more than intended. "In theory I'd like to purchase more, but I'd really just be blindly picking
			things I
			have
			very little knowledge of. Sigh... I really do think there's a lot of potency in magic, but being able to
			point
			it in the
			right direction is just as important. Maybe next time."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape lifts her arms over her head, further calling attention to herself. "Yeah. Like, I could hold my own
			even
			like
			this, but I'd really rather not test that theory. Honestly I'm sort of ready to go whenever you are, but an
			agreement is
			an agreement. I'll just sit pretty... Grab me, my purse, and my staff when you're ready, I guess." Her voice
			is
			just a
			bit pitch-shifted, but not laughably so. She lowers her arms and sighs. "Eh, Silver, I guess you could just
			purchase
			more later, yeah. We'll find some proper ways to test what they do next time in your place. And, yeah,
			magic's
			pretty
			sweet even when it's like this, maybe."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			The kitsune restocks several of the items, and when she's close to Shape's end of the room she leans beside
			her.
			"I'm
			not so sure that's true. I'm very tall, and those traits you so seem to admire could come back to haunt
			you."
			She
			laughs, and some of her sharp molars come to light in it. "It's been great catching up again. Thought I'd
			never
			see you
			again, but here you came again, how interesting and annoying—and, you, Silver, how genuinely interesting you
			are.
			Someone dedicated to a craft of honest, straight magic. I hope we talk soon again, maybe one-to-one that
			time.
			Just the
			bigger people in the room, hmm?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver does seem slightly on edge as Jae-eun puts herself so close to the mostly defenseless Shape. All this
			bickering
			and teasing is getting on her nerves. And she expresses, quite strictly, with a layer of silver on her
			voice.
			"Be at
			least vaguely nice to Shape, Jae-eun. I don't know whatever feuding you two have going on but I have no
			appreciation for
			it." She picks up the purse, checking that it as well as the contents are unaffected by the shrinking - the
			car
			keys
			seem to still hold a natural size, which is good. The purse and the staff is already a bit much to wield so
			she
			considers taking those to the car first.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			Jae-eun winces from the partial command and provoking Silver's criticisms once more. She sits far away. And
			her
			tails
			wave. "Fine. Again, it's been good business. I'll respect that." She checks her phone.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			The small shapeshifter winks at Silver. "Thanks. She deserved that. I'm really quite sick of it as well. Out
			of
			all the
			people in the world to hold a grudge over, why the shapeshifter who wasn't even trying to be the bad morals
			trickster,
			y’know? Since, you know, that's the media stereotype. I'm talking to you, Jae-eun."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver squints down the tiny Shape. "I very much could have you too, but I actually honor things I've
			promised.
			Be
			thankful for that. So please, be equally nice in return while I head out to the car. If you prod her too
			much,
			remember
			that her enchant is a vague suggest and can at worst be broken through." She excuses herself from the room,
			having to
			take an extra bit of care to not catch any of her tails in any of the doors. The staff goes back where Shape
			had
			left it
			earlier in the car, and the purse goes in the foot end of the front passenger seat since Shape won't need
			that
			space
			anyhow.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape shrugs and slumps over. "Tell you what, then, Silver. I'll just sit here and behave for once. I'll
			take
			what I can
			get with Jae-eun, even if it's a 'vague suggestion.'" She watches Silver leave and later return to the room.
			And
			she
			smirks at the fox woman. Jae-eun complacency remains all the same, though. The social media on her phone
			maintains her
			observation.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Not wanting to disturb the quiet, Silver scoops up the box and makes haste to place it carefully in the back
			of
			the car.
			Upon her second return, she leans over the back of Shape's chair. "I do suppose that's it for now, Jae-Eun.
			I
			could very
			well return sometime later, for other ware. You have my contact so if something new of yours seems like it'd
			appeal,
			don't be afraid to notify. I will take my small friend with me and leave now, many thanks for business."
		<p>
			Silver is almost in the motions of simply picking up Shape when she realizes that maybe asking first would
			be a
			good
			choice. "Do you want a hand to the car or will you take the journey on your own legs?

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaeeun_w">
		<p>
			Jae-eun looks up from her cell phone, and she says, "Oh, I'll let you know, like I said we always have new
			inventory and
			you've skyrocketed into being my number one customer! So let's chat soon, Silver!" Her tails rise and wave,
			and
			her
			toothy smile sails past over the ShapeShifter's head.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah—I'm not excited to walk all the way there like this. I think actually if you were to compare the size
			of
			my legs
			with the size of a normal-sized person's legs maybe walking to the car would be like a mile or something."
			She
			suspends
			her arms out above and in front of her like a young child looking to be held against someone's chest and
			shoulders. She
			says, "If you think this is weird, Silver, just remember that potions could have always made things even
			weirder."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"Bit of an overstatement, maybe, but I take your point." Shape gets a boost out of the chair, though is held
			more like a
			cat than a small child, and Silver takes them out of the room. They exit to the car and she makes sure to
			tuck
			shape
			into the passenger seat swiftly before too many passersby get a close look. "In hindsight, I should indeed
			be
			happy one
			of us is capable of driving back home. I'll need a bit to figure out these tails in the car, though... Ugh.
			I
			feel weird
			now that we're outside. I'm always one to not draw more attention than necessary. Let's just get back to
			your
			place as
			soon as possible." She almost closes the car door on several of the tails, but does hesitate in the last
			moment
			and
			retracts them from the frame.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape holds onto the seat belt with both of her hands. She says, "Yeah, I mean, I'm also just glad you had
			my
			back for
			this potion stuff. You even drank your potion. I really don't think you realize how dangerous potions can
			be,
			but it's a
			really appreciated gesture, y'know?" As the car starts and lurches from its parking spot, Shape bounces
			against
			the seat
			belt. "The good news is that our changes are probably harder to notice anyway, though, Silver. Like, I'm too
			short to be
			visible from outside the car most of the time, and your tails are hidden rather well if you aren't holding
			them
			up."
			Shape scoots closer to Silver and reaches out one hand to touch the closest of Silver's eight tails. She
			smiles.
			"Oh,
			and that was your first magic used on or against you, I think, right? That's kind of fun."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I... Do suppose it is my first experience in receiving magic, yes. And as you can assume, my impression is
			somewhat
			mixed. But I do have hope that I can find more interesting, better means of utilizing external magic in the
			future.
			Without knowing the extents, the possibilities are theoretically limitless until I try, you know?" Silver
			certainly has
			a more relaxed driving style than Shape presented earlier, to protect the potions and a tiny Shape's
			well-being.
			In that
			order. "I do realize that you can't really look up and out of the front window. If I forget the way we're
			going,
			we'll
			have to figure something out." The tail and its closest neighbor do wave closer to shape, and covers her in
			a
			generous
			swishing of fuzz.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Well, I promise I'll see about showing you something like a magic being or proper magic artifact next time.
			How's that?
			Of course, it's sort of been a while for me honestly, I've not been very motivated to go leave the city in a
			while."
			Shape nuzzles into the two tails, falling back on her adoration of fluffy fox tails. She says, "Eh, we can
			put
			on the
			GPS or something. And I wouldn't say magic is limitless, yeah, no. It's got its fair share of rules,
			stipulations, and
			consequences. You know how my thing works, for instance. Hardly any magic we'd find would be catch-free, but
			I'm
			sure
			we'd come by something that interests you." Presumably, of course, an item that'd potentially help Silver's
			probably
			wicked intentions. Shape hugs one of the tails, letting the seat belt drape over her blouse hands-free.
			"So...
			Have you
			always had this Silver Tongue?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I'd ask you to put on the GPS but I assume your little arms can't reach the screen. I'll find a stopping
			spot
			soon."
			Silver thinks for a bit, unsure how to answer. "Well... That's a complicated question. Is it possible to
			know
			when a
			power originates if you had to learn you can wield it mostly by accident? When it blended with a perception
			of
			simply
			being persuasive? I like to believe it developed in later years and I simply was a convincing person before
			that,
			skilled with words naturally too, but that might be wishful thinking. Maybe I did truly have budding powers
			early on and
			some of my school grades are illicitly earned. What I do know is that it is fully developed since many years
			ago. I
			wield the same strength of power as when I got my first personal computer for free, at the age of seventeen.
			That's when
			I was found out for certain I was unnatural, had capabilities others don't, could use them to my benefit and
			had
			to
			consider the wider impact of such decisions. The man I manipulated lost his job over it, of course. And that
			honestly
			hurt me more than you'd expect. Do all I can to be aware of consequences since..."
		<p>
			She sighs. Was that more information than needed? She's always been hesitant to speak of these things
			because
			they
			pertain to her magic. But now that the topic of magic already is on the table, she hasn't yet decided if
			there's
			other
			reasons to keep details to herself.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			A cold shiver runs through Shape's spine during Silver's first rhetorical question, and she takes seconds to
			regain
			focus. She listens thereafter, stroking one of the tails in her arms. She nods and returns Silver's sigh.
			She
			says,
			"You've been relatively convincing even without using your abilities on me, if it's any consolation?—But,
			umm, I
			really
			appreciate getting to hear that. I honestly had a similar experience in some ways. Except in my case it
			wasn't
			that I
			was using some power of manipulation from an early age without knowing, obviously. Instead, I figured out I
			could
			physically change my form into a copy of a lot of things, especially people, when I was a child. And it was
			an
			accident,
			and I did it in a very wrong place to do it." She buries her eyes into the tail. "To be honest, yeah, I'm
			glad
			your
			ability at least has obvious positive application, if we're still drawing contrasts. You could help so many
			more
			people
			than I ever could, is all. Even if you've hurt people before, like that computer store employee or
			whatever."
			She takes
			a deep breath. Some dampness settles inside the white fur.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"Oh dear, hmm... When you hear made up stories of shapeshifters and the likes, it's always grown people with
			full
			control over it. I can't say I've ever considered the fact that it much be so much trouble to grow into, and
			not
			handle
			well at first. You know me... I run away when my powers get me into situations I can't as easily power
			myself
			back out
			of. And there's a lot of cases where I can do that. Shapeshifting I assume has much less that liberty."
			Silver
			sighs
			deeply, and pulls over at a bus stop to fiddle with the GPS. "I wonder if I'd ever be able to use a
			different
			power
			nearly as effectively. Or if I'd simply not be the way I am in that case. Who knows." Hesitantly, she
			reaches
			over and
			pats Shape on the head. She doesn't quite appreciate the sensation of damp fur, but she doesn't complain.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"All the stories and myths about shapeshifters aren't true anyway, it's all Hollywood smoke and mirrors. I'm
			not
			a
			prankster, I don't intend to trick people out of anything. I just wanted to settle down and have a normal
			life
			for at
			least a while, distance myself from all that came before then, and I've done that already. I'm not a
			monster,
			I'm not
			some science project. I'm not an alien in a test tube. You get my point..." She sniffles, and she looks up
			at
			Silver's
			comforting hand. "Thanks. Yeah, sorry... It just depends on the power you get. And... I didn't have as much
			flexibility
			out of situations as you might initially believe, yeah. Or at least not in ways I'm comfortable talking
			about."
			She
			leans back from the tail and rests her head on the seat. "I've made it my mission for a while to make people
			happy, I
			guess. That's who I am now—I just wanted to say that."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver hums and ponders for a moment, but really does not know where to continue this peculiar interaction.
			So
			she pulls
			out of the bus stop, making sure that the soothing robotic voice of the GPS cuts through the silence
			sufficiently. "I'll
			join you at your home. I can't guarantee myself you'll be completely fine on your own."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			She plays with a loose thread from the car seat cushion. Her lips are curled down. "That makes sense."
