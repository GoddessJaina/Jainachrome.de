		<p>
			Shape brushes her hair, checking the result with the scummy bathroom mirror. And then she runs by her
			adjacent bedroom once more and plucks the yellow gem necklace from the desk that Silver bought her. This
			will do for their encounter nicely.
		<p>
			She hears the front door as she's heading down, and she opens it to Silver. Compared to their first
			encounter, Shape is significantly more touched up. She's wearing something of a knee-length skirt and dress,
			beige and white and modestly revealing her shoulders, breasts, and arms.
		<p>
			She says, “Hey, Silver. I thought for our hangout I'd try on a different look this time. I was thinking
			about even wearing lipstick, I hadn't done that in a while, but I wanted to maybe share a wine with you and
			not stain the glass.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			There is a very brief look of confusion on Silver's face, but it fades and she giggles instead. "Ah yes.
			Shape. The Shape-Shifter. I don't think I ever specified but don't worry, I do appreciate guys and girls
			alike. So I'll gladly take you as you prefer. May I come in?"
		<p>
			In comparison, Silver has mostly chosen a similar attire to always, but it's not like her casual attire
			lacks the fanciness to be excused as proper eveningwear as well. She does have a bit more striking heels
			than before, which adds to her height advantage over Shape.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“Of course! Come on in, and thank you, yeah. I did figure maybe you were looking to rest your eyes on a
			pretty lady today~,” She says. She immediately heads to the kitchen, where a pitcher of water and wine
			bottle and glasses already were. And she asks if Silver wants any of that. She continues, “It's a red wine.
			Are you a fan of those?”
		<p>
			She returns to the living room with some glasses for them, and she smiles with pleasant teeth. Her legs fold
			across one another, and she waves the television remote. “You look good too, Silver. See, yeah, part of the
			reason I'm dressed up too is I realized you're in, say, the country club tier of people? Given your wealth
			and valuable time. So I thought it'd be fun to play into that. I don't have television, but I could setup a
			movie or game if you like.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I do fancy myself a smaller amount of wine on occasion, thank you." Her gaze does fall up and down the
			length of the new Shape as she walks away into the kitchen. Good features, certainly. Shapeshifters have it
			nice in that regard, Silver thinks to herself. She moves to take a seat but eyes the living room over with
			some hesitance. She's still vaguely conscious about getting too close to Shape, but she settles at the end
			of the sofa. "I have been on occasion to some country clubs, yes. Good arrangements can be made there. I
			never quite caught the knack for golf but it honestly had its upsides. Wealthy men do get a bit thoughtless
			around women they think they can underestimate safely... I don't mean to go too much into that tangent
			though. I'm curious, what manner of games do you play?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			She sips a bit of the water she poured herself. The wine glasses for both of them and Silver's water are
			still on the coffee table. Lady Shape says, “Yeah... Golf seems kind of dreadful. Everything I see on
			television about it seems designed to put people to sleep, I don't know. I guess there's got to be good
			money in it for those good at it, sure. Or at least good at manipulation.” She rolls her eyes. “Anyway,
			yeah, I play... a few video games, sometimes. Like a fighting game. But when people are over I do own a few
			board games I play with them, or even just like social games that don't necessarily have a board. For the
			physical board games though, I have like a trivia board game. If you like answering trivia-- oh, maybe
			you're more into strategy though-- or I even have a cooperative one.” She's managed to be kneeling inside an
			opened closet in this room, reading off the games.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"Video games really are not my forte, unfortunately. They go so fast and I am someone who enjoys a leisurely
			pace." She takes a small nip at her glass; quite certainly adequate, she's been offered some questionable
			swills in her past before so it's always nice to be pleased.
		<p>
			"You have my attention at cooperative games. I find that having a winner and loser gets a bit repetitive on
			occasions so a teamwork game sounds quite curious." She lifts her glass and eyes over the gentle silver
			sparkle of her own lipstick on its rim.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“Yeah... I'm not going to lie, I'm not the quickest on my feet about that either. It's very casual stuff. I
			agree about playing the cooperative board game, then, yeah.” Shape hums, lifts the box from the stack, and
			walks over to the coffee table. She makes room for the board. It's the street map of a damp and sickly night
			city, not terribly modern. Colored dice, human pawns, and some small cards plop on top. “This game's called
			Murder on Cobblestone. Basically, yeah there's a bunch of rules you could read in this pamphlet, but the
			idea is our characters in it are investigators have some possible scripted events and tasks in the city that
			we accomplish with dice rolls, having the characters share information, maybe dealing with some villains...”
			She joins Silver and sips wine too.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"Murder on Cobblestone, a wonderful name for a game. I applaud whoever comes up with these." She takes yet
			another sip, and then sets the glass down to analyze the board more curiously. She takes a blue piece off
			the board and holds it between her fingers. "Are these any real significances to the colors or may I claim
			this one for myself?"
		<p>
			Her instinct is to read over the rules in meticulous detail, but wasting half an hour of their precious time
			doing that in silence seems very not productive to having a social evening so she'll follow along with
			Shape's leaning towards winging it, maybe.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape scans the rules, murmuring, “Don't see why not. You're the blue piece then. Is your character the kind
			that'd... hold a flintlock, or a knife, or maybe just sneak up and strangle with a rope?” Shape wasn't going
			to waste a whole the evening away to precise rulings, no. The gameplay loop was simple enough once it got
			going. But, indeed, there were preliminary steps. Shape shuffles the small card decks and she says, “I want
			a gun, in any case. I'll take a flintlock. And maybe this perk for adjusting a roll once every three turns.”
			She points out the starting choices for character abilities and single tool. She pulls the table a bit
			closer to the couch with both of them.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I think doubling up sounds not conducive to learning the varieties of gameplay, so I will let my dear Miss
			Blueston have a knife. If your rules say she can't be a Miss, those are bad rules." She scans across the
			list of perks. "Ah, yes. I think I will settle for the double move on rolling a one or a two. Sounds like
			excellent insurance for whatever manner of moving this game might need."
		<p>
			It's a peculiar change of nature for Silver to suddenly seem quite invested in playing a silly board game,
			but it suits her well and she doesn't seem to mind it at all.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“Yeah. I guess I'm doing green. I'll name her... Tea. Lady Tea.” Shape giggles, and she plants their pawns
			at the starting position, a police station. “Yeah, no, modern board games are the darnest things, they'll
			even specify in the rules for ones like this usually that male and female characters are evenly attributed.
			We can be ladies, legally.” She sips from her wine and reads off a card, and rolls a dice. “The crime was
			conducted to the beloved barber! He was cut into three pieces, and there's like this long trail of blood in
			some photos Tea can see that goes from the middle of the street to the alley they found him.” She hands
			Silver a card and the dice. “Your character could probably get some more insight too, and maybe we can solve
			a puzzle at the crime or just snoop for witnesses?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver feigns a quite shocked gasp at the revelation of the murder. "Oh no, not the beloved barber! Let's
			see here..." She rolls a dice and scans the card herself, raising an eyebrow. "So, it seems that some of the
			barber's tools are bloodied, but none of them seem large enough to actually commit the act of, you know."
			She makes a scissor cutting motion indicating the fact of how not in one piece he is.
		<p>
			"How recent is this, would you say? I think if it's quite fresh we must investigate the scene before it is
			too late. Certainly in the weather that seems to permeate this city as well." Silver gently puts the card
			back onto the table, face down. Shape should know what to do with it.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape simply discards that card and the previous card into a new pile, facing down still. And after a couple
			minutes of awkward turns passing buildings in the evening light and greeting the crime scene, Lady Tea and
			Miss Blueston have found a cypher rolled up in a paper in the barber's sleeve. Shape comments, “I would have
			not been that observant in a million years, but I guess that's what having a roll of 4 is like. But yeah,
			good idea to check the scene. I wonder what the... jumbled letters could mean. I guess we should see if
			there's something we could find like an encryption key?” Lady Tea, once she's finished showing Miss Blueston
			the original encryption paper, writes a copy on a slip of paper in her notebook, rips it out, and... puts it
			between her tits, to quote Shape.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Miss Blueston raises an eyebrow at her colleague's choice of storage, but it's as useful as any, surely. The
			two of them return to the barbershop, in case there's things to deduce about the purpose of the crime or how
			it was committed. "Say, what exactly are we racing or wagering against in this game? Or is this truly just a
			leisurely murder mystery we'll see through to the end?" She realizes she's finished her glass as she goes to
			take another sip, and seems a tad surprised by this. The entire edge of the glass is stained in small
			amounts of shimmering silver, but it looks more ornately decorated than stained at a quick glance.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape heads to the kitchen and returns with the wine bottle, saying in the meantime, “In this game, there's
			kind of a multi-layered losing condition, you can sort of think of it less like losing and more having worse
			and worse wins. The best possible win being maybe that we manage to stop the criminal from killing anyone
			else when we capture them quickly. We have like 40 turns for that or something, so a large amount of time
			still, yeah.” She goes ahead and tips the bottle of wine for Silver's glass, not really expecting her to
			drink much more but wanting to present opulence in providing it. And, yeah, Shape drinks more from her own
			glass and pours into her own. Miss Blueston is the first to notice that one of the chairs is both the only
			chair pulled out from the barber mirror and hair products and the only chair with a large clump of black
			hair. Tea finds the hair spray is freshly opened, and the cutting tools are missing. “I guess the barber
			took the tools to the crime site,” Shape says.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver doesn't have time to consider if she wants to object to more wine. Respectfully, she takes one more
			little nip at the liquid. "I see, then. Black hair— that should narrow things down somewhat, though... It's
			a shame this isn't the kind of time where people frequently have vivid and distinct hairs. A suspected
			killer with purple hair would be much more distinct." Miss Blueston pockets some locks of the hair, and
			takes Lady Tea's hand to lead the pair back to the scene. Probably not the most time efficient approach, but
			leads are somewhat linear so far and it seems obvious to her to pursue those.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape says, “Ah, you're a fan of vivid hair colors and stuff? I'll have to keep that in mind maybe. Maybe I
			could take a request.” She seems to speak just a bit looser. Tea happily walks along Miss Blueston's side,
			even leaning on her a bit at the crime scene. Unfortunately, the hair and hairspray didn't shed a ton of
			light on the scene. However, a man from the police station at the scene tips them some of the suspected
			witnesses, including some bar guests across the street of the alley. Lady Tea walks closely with Blueston to
			the bar and inquires the bartender if he was there last night, too.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"Say, as we're doing such good parts being in character, I do wonder how green would suit you. You could be
			my very own Lady Tea, in person." She giggles, amusedly. The bar is quite dusty and stuffy, and Miss
			Blueston takes on Silver's confidence of being quite upfront, asking more broadly if anyone in the bar has
			seen anything pertaining to last night's happenstances.
		<p>
			The bartender had been working here last night, but was largely distracted due to two instances of patrons
			having quite some disagreements. Only one person of the second pair is mentioned to have black hair. Lucas
			something or other, his name, and he is distinctly not present today. Some other people second these
			scuffles, and one other person claims to vaguely recall curious sounds on the way home last night but was
			too drunk to have much detail or remember when this was.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“Green? Yeah, sure, I can do that. Give me just a second, Silver.” Shape leans back into the couch and
			disassociates from the game and her surroundings. And Shape's head of hair develops a strange fog of
			sand-colored particles, and then her outfit also is wrapped in a thin layer of this dust. In just a few
			seconds, Shape's hair and dress are entirely the light green found in the game. And she adjusts her eyes
			afterward to fit that color, as an afterthought. “Lady Tea, at your service.” She leans back into the board
			and smiles. Silver has a sexy giggle.
		<p>
			Lady Tea suggests to Miss Blueston that they should see if police records exist for Lucas and possibly the
			bartender. Then Tea suggests that the way the blood trail disappears into the street might be an indicator
			that the perpetrator owned a vehicle of some variety. Bar attendees, surprisingly, give a response about the
			vehicle Lucas drove. And so, excitedly, Tea asks if they passed a house or building with that vehicle. Shape
			drinks and shrugs. “It's totally Lucas.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver leans in, observing with a distinct amazement. She's so used to being underhanded, subtle, and
			secretive about her means and has little experience otherwise. Seeing someone else actually perform and lean
			into magical acts strikes her in a most peculiar way. She eyes the results very approvingly, and gives a
			smile in return. "That is... Hm. Wow. You did announce it and everything but it really isn't something I was
			quite prepared for." She takes an almost nervous sip of drink. "Is magic... Always so beautiful, or is that
			just you?"
		<p>
			Miss Blueston nods along with the comments and notes but she seems much more absent than two turns ago. When
			realizing that Tea asked about the car, she has to admit that she's not entirely sure what the premise of
			the question was in the first place.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape glances up from the board once more, and sits up. Slowly. She sips again and stretches her arms back.
			“Nobody's ever prepared for my magic. It's quality stuff. And it's not just the magic, Silver, dear. Thank
			you for your very, very kind words.” A bit of the wine drips out of the cup. She brings it forward again on
			the table. And she continues to smile. “You're beautiful yourself. Like... Ivory, in business casual.” She
			pushes the cup against the board, toppling over one of the card stacks, and she picks up after the small
			mess.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Miss Blueston simply continues to wait in silence for Lady Tea's response but the pair seem like they're
			frozen in time, somehow.
		<p>
			Silver, too, takes a small sip of the wine, seeming very struck still. "I wish I got to see magic more
			often, now. Even as someone with it, I tend to simply stick with the belief that it doesn't exist to avoid
			giving things away when I shouldn't. I have to pretend it's a secret to me too. It's almost like being
			ashamed of it, as if acknowledging it is a mistake. Not that I've met anyone else with such capacities
			before you. Maybe if I knew it was more proliferated from the start I'd have seen things differently." The
			various green details of the recolored Shape keep catching Silver's eyes, as if the fact that this is still
			the same person that was before here only minutes ago is repeatedly a major surprise.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape finishes the card stack, and she scoots on the floor a bit from her side of the table and more to
			Silver's. She nods, and says facing Silver, “Hmmm. That sucks. I don't like to pretend it doesn't exist to
			people that much, like sure I pretend right but like... It's only for my protection, when I know it's safe
			or I can enchant someone's life for the better I like to... Stick with me though I'll show you more magic.
			Lots more magic than even mine out there. You'll see.” She sighs, and she rests her shoulder on the table.
			“I know I got totally mad the other day but. It's not a secret anymore. Your magic is safe here if you want
			to twirl... Any sorts of conjuring. What do you do again? It's like mind stuff and what else?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"Lots more magic? You have my curiosity. What kinds of magics could you show me?" Silver stops to think.
			It's a little bit slower and less effective than usual. How much wine did she have already? More than
			intended, but whatever. "What I do is... Fairly diverse, in the range of thought alteration. But that's the
			only thing I have. I call it the Silver Tongue, and I can use it to speak directly into people's minds. The
			strength of it depends on how strongly I apply it; trying to hide it and make sure people do not notice
			means I can only be strongly persuasive in the moment usually. I can bypass this to some degree with eye
			contact. But if I raise my voice and let my magic really flow, I can do very severe things to people.
			Captivate them for longer times, override memories on a lasting manner lest they find a way to pry at
			inconsistencies and break the illusion. Being alone with someone or affecting everyone present means I have
			that freedom, since I can then amend their observations of the act... I got a bit carried away, maybe? You
			asked, and I've never had much chance to talk about this to someone else." She takes another drink to stifle
			her awkwardness- and then realizes she did intend to not do more of that. Oh well.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			“Oh, you know, like there's witches and elves and dragons, maybe some gods, there's like weird objects that
			have magical properties right, but most of them are kinda specific and unruly, a rare couple aren't but
			usually those are safe kept yeah. Don't have great experiences over all with objects. But like say you
			wanted me to do weird mind or body stuff to a much more limited-- extent, I could probably figure a way to
			make that happen.” She sighs and arrives at Silver's side of the table, and she rests her back partially
			atop of it. “Wow... The Silver Tongue. Even as focused of an ability as it is, that's very powerful and--
			diverse yeah. Really cool, really wicked. I can definitely see how you're so persuasive. Have I've already
			been persuaded?” She giggles and shakes her head. “No, though, I'm pretty sure here it's your charisma. Your
			charm... I'd know otherwise because I'd sense the presence of your Silver Tongue... I'm glad you feel
			comfortable with the opportunity to share. Honestly, so much of your person is going to be also in your
			magic and how you use it. We are magic people. There's no avoiding that being a factor. In us.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I haven't attempted to influence you past the one unfortunate and overly instinctive moment, so far. Not
			only because you seem one to notice if I were to, but... I did promise. If you are curious though, I
			could... Demonstrate."
		<p>
			The thought of Vera crosses her mind. She doesn't want to consider that right now, though, and shakes it
			off. Her hand moves closer to Shape, and ends up gently resting on her knee as that's the part of her Silver
			can currently reach. "Magical objects, hmm. I'd be very curious about such things. There's bound to be some
			that are awfully convenient and would be useful to have... Ah, I'm scheming again. I am awfully results
			oriented at time, as you may have noticed."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape shakes her head and grins. “Be curious all you want, then~. I don't have to show you any of the
			magical objects if I don't want. You'd have to make me. And, yes, there are some that are quite convenient
			and quite accessible. Hmm?” She stares at Silver from this skewered perspective, and adjusts her knee into
			the hand. She says, “Thank you for not having attempted since then. I am, though, just a bit curious... I
			have to admit, I have never felt cozier with someone so manipulative. Such a wonderful collection of
			features and skills you have.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"...Show them? Hmm. Does that mean you actually have some of them yourself? That's very interesting. Well,
			then, my dear Shape. Ahem." She adds just the slightest suggestion to her voice. "Please, sit up, I can't
			demonstrate well without looking at you properly."
		<p>
			Even if prompted, she feels a bit awkward at first doing so to Shape, but it's a very mild one. Not
			something she couldn't defy, just a strong inclination that it's a natural and good idea to sit up properly
			and look at Silver.
		<p>
			"...How does that feel? I've heard some various odd descriptors thrown about but not from anyone who expects
			it."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape hums, and she sits up onto the edge of the table properly. It... Should have enough support for old
			her. She looks into Silver's eyes, and shrugs. “Sure thing, boss... Tell you what, it feels like. I don't
			know, like an alternative voice of reason. Like you've placed yourself in the part of my head that makes
			subconscious ideas happen and then finally thoughts about what to do.” She pauses, and she puts her hand on
			the one Silver has on her knee. “It feels imposing, warm like an electric lamp, sexy-- well, you know, more
			than mine.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver takes mental notes of this. She isn't going to let an opportunity to do actual science on her own
			powers pass unused. “Curious, and very insightful. Speaking of curiosity... You did say that you won't share
			with me your magical oddments but. Oh, I am so curious, I simply must see them. Magic is so beautiful, isn't
			it? Tonight is all about sharing this magic, it seems, so why don't we take a look at what other magical
			curiosities you may present~?” There's again a warm static connecting Silver's eyes and Shape's eyes, and
			she doesn't even try to conceal the magical aspect of it, though she's aware she laid on thick with the
			appeal to natural agreement as opposed to just commanding Shape.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape's eyes stay locked on Silver throughout her carefully worded poem of enchanted thought. It never truly
			became unwilling, and yet it never was something Shape wanted to give to her without casual resistance,
			access to these magical items “that she may present.” But... From the ease of which Shape guided her
			influence into her mind for this one, Shape now agreed. She moves from the table, guiding her feet to a
			stand, and says, “I have to admit, Silver, I'd be delighted to share them with you tonight. All magic really
			is beautiful.” She continues to hold Silver's hand, though, as she walks with Silver to the stairway. She
			smirks. “It's in my bedroom, dear.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver stands up, taking the lead she herself had guided, like a carriage following a horse. In the end, the
			carriage decides the way after all. The holding of hands is genuine, though, and while she's well familiar
			with people following her orders, this time it's so distinctly different. She had, in turn, been baited into
			applying this influence most deliberately by Shape, and there was no secret about it. Like a game, and not a
			business endeavor.
		<p>
			She does not know how to feel about this.
		<p>
			"I do suppose a bedroom is a good place to hide away toys you don't want anyone and everyone to see." She
			muses in return.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			Shape leads them up the stairway excitedly, almost tripping given her faint buzz. And when they reach the
			bedroom, Shape closes the door behind them with a click. She says, “Yeah. I'd describe potent magical
			artifacts as toys, too. In this case, though, I have two kinds in my house.” On the window frame under the
			beady night stars of the urban sky, a spear of a black, cold rod and green stony tip leans against the wall.
			A red ribbon wraps just below the stone, at the top of the rod. Shape walks over to it, holds it up, and
			keeps the tip away from Silver. “This was a gift. It will hurt, a lot, if you even so much as nick your
			finger on the green part of this. It's like being set on fire around the area of contact. I never got used
			to the feeling.” Then Shape places the spear back and walks to the closet across from her dark-blanketed
			bed. She gets onto her knees and dials a combination lock on a safe, and produces three brilliant stones.
			Purple, red, and orange, differently jagged and glowing like salt lamps. She sits atop the bed with these
			strange rocks strewn about the cover beside her, and she plops her legs across the cover. “These are rune
			stones. The purple one lets you change bodies, the red one lets you change minds, and the orange one lets
			you swap bodies. Think Freaky Friday. Here's the thing though, it only works if both the person activating
			the change and the person receiving the change hold the stone at the same time. They also have to agree to
			the effect, basically.” She blinks. “You never even asked I explain them, for the record. I'm just being
			helpful.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver watches the spear with a curious gaze, almost seeming a bit disappointed that it simply does not look
			largely magical from the outside. She has no intents of actually assuring herself that it's magically
			unpleasant and nasty, and takes Shape's word for it. The rocks, however, fill that visual gap much better -
			Silver sits down a respectable distance from Shape and leans in to get a closer look, though she's very wary
			not to touch them. She has absolutely no experience with artefacts, after all, so even Shape's description
			of its use doesn't immediately dispel her concern.
		<p>
			"Changing minds, changing bodies... What a coincidence that this is exactly what we two are already good
			at." She giggles notably more than she usually would, given her influence. "Changing bodies... I wonder, I
			really do. I never got to truly find out if my Silver Tongue is tied to the body, or to the mind. I know it
			gets much weaker if my voice gives out, or I have a cold." She would not have said such a thing on most
			days, but wine and newfound fascination for magic are a potent combination.

			Shape starts climbing into the bed covers and sheets, of course entirely without prompt. She stows the rune
			stones under the covers, and she starts taking her green dress off, her white skirt intact. “It's too warm
			if I wear this under my blanket... Oh, the orange one, yeah, that one is something neither of us can really
			do, yeah. Or I guess technically the red one lets me change your body or, say, make you think I'm actually
			funny. But I'm not interested in that.” She tosses her dress aside onto the ground, and bundles her bra-clad
			chest to the cover. She tugs the portion of it under where Silver is sitting. “You're welcome to join me if
			you like, Silver... And umm. I think your Silver Tongue, maybe, is tied to the body, if you struggle with a
			cold. I struggle to shapeshift under the weather, and it's in the blood. You don't want my powers, though;
			you'd have trouble with them.”

			Shape's transformation to a bedded state is unexpected, and Silver seems somewhat startled. Nonetheless, she
			does make herself comfortable by taking her heels and jacket off, using a short trip to Shape's desk for
			depositing as an excuse to let her pull the blanket in properly. "The blood? Hm. An odd place to keep magic,
			but I do suppose it makes sense. It's, in a sense, the very essence of your body." Silver allows herself
			into the bed as well, a respectable foot of distance to start. Her hair covers quite much of the pillow and
			she takes some effort to brush it into a useful position as she turns to face her company. "I'd almost
			believe you've been affecting me this time, I feel honestly much more comfortable than I'd assume after all
			this."

			Shape smiles at Silver a most warm smile, and she honors Silver's space despite this blessing. She says,
			“Yeah. I wish I knew why my blood was that way.” She rests her left ear on the pillow, and she doesn't
			bother adjusting her green hair, although there's much less of it. “I'm really glad you feel comfortable.
			What I've done is no magic, no spell, no trick. I simply am getting to know you, having a bit of fun with
			you, and showing my true colors-- to you.” She closes her eyes slowly, and keeps them closed. “We are magic,
			but we are so much more than that too... You're not just an enchanted tongue. I'm not sure if I'm drunk and
			you're drunk, but I hope you remember everything, especially that.” And say goodbye when she has to leave.

			"I have to admit I didn't intend to get this much wine but I do suppose it may have helped some things
			along, for better or for worse. I'll care about that what the time comes to do so." She can't help but be
			amused at the mention of colors, emphasizing it with a short run of her fingers through Shape's hair. "I
			think I am some ways from being blacked out in the morning, don't you worry." She eases herself into a rest
			as well... The thought of forgetting the night brings her back to thinking about Vera. Getting drunk enough
			to lose memory would be somewhat of the same thing, she supposes.
