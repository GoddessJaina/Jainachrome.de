		<p>
			It only took a quick private plane reservation and submerged vehicle, but a distant Vera Hanley has been
			home for a few hours now, tending to a proper Italian dish and her massive log of notes. When she reviews
			her notes concerning today's events, she stops chewing her food and spits some of it back on the dish. "Why
			did I abandon the interview? Hello?" She wasn't on an official assignment, but any interview, on or off the
			clock, would end when she said it'd end-- or something severe happened. And Vera terminated it because
			someone, this Silver, asked her to?
		<p>
			About thirty minutes later, Silver receives a phone number with international digits.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver's has just barely made herself comfortable back at home when she has to turn the TV on mute. She
			isn't even sure what she's looking at yet, but odds are it really doesn't matter. What she does know is that
			generally, taking a call is better than missing them. Just in case something in her vast web of influences
			has gone awry and needs to be attended to.
		<p>
			"Hello, you are talking to Silver. How may I help you?" It's a trained voice, formal and businesslike. A
			good fallback, considering she doesn't want her current mood to bleed into the conversation.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Last time we talked you didn't seem eager to answer me. So this time I have a single question for you:
			Silver, how did you make me leave the café?" She has a pristine speaking voice, Vera, and she so often uses
			it for the most unpleasant of exchanges. She continues, glossing over her plan outline, "I am certain it was
			your fault. I would never, for any reason, cut an interview because someone smiled and asked. Let's gut that
			misconception."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Oh, god. Not this, not now. Not her. Silver could never have realized that Vera's this level of workaholic
			and stubborn that she'd piece together matters just from being dismissed once. She'd have poor hopes of
			convincing her way out of a one on one meeting, let alone over the phone.
		<p>
			"I do not know what you're talking about, Miss Blogger. You seemed a bit unwell, I think I recall, are you
			sure you really just weren't up for it? The atmosphere in the café was pretty heavy." She dares not infuse
			any degree of influence in her words. Vera would notice something being off with Silver's tone well before
			it had any real effect, and it's obvious she's very set in her ways.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Silver, I don't need anyone to decipher my own intentions. I'm well aware of what I desire." She pauses
			while she notes an abbreviated version of this dismissive claim. Town AI would have a backup of this entire
			exchange anyway. "It's precedent that Shape meets magical people. I won't go in further detail, however this
			leads me to believe, combined with the case I've presented so far, that you're magical or bear technology
			that is indistinguishable from magic." That's a familiar quote. "Evidently, I'm going to work out the
			details. With or without your assistance. At least apologize to me, manipulator."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Vera can practically hear the eye-rolling in Silver's voice as she puts on her snarkiest-but-still-dignified
			tone.
		<p>
			"Fine. I'm so sorry for being a big bad evil witch sorceress who's here to cause mayhem and destruction by
			convincing poor innocent interrogators that they have unusual mood swings."
		<p>
			Something about Vera's tone and mannerisms is quite upsetting though, she's very professional and proper -
			there's little chance she's just a casual hobby blogger like it seemed at first. And she's aware of Shape's
			magic, and about its, even to Silver, somewhat more frequent abundance. She's a threat, much more so than
			Shape. "Listen, I do not know what you want, but what I want is to get some well-earned rest. It's been a
			very long day. So I'd appreciate if you would... Actually? Where did you get my number, anyhow? I can't
			recall giving it to you."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She adjusts the position of the tablet, causing noise to register in the microphone, and then she says, "I
			believe that's sarcasm, although I'd believe it... Sorry that you're exhausted, however I wanted a real
			apology. And, beyond this call, the truth." She continues, "I convinced Shape using 'cool magic powers' to
			share your phone number. I have burner numbers as well, and therefore I will be able to call often."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver is not going to back down from this easily. Not only is she hard in her ways, she also has a lot
			riding on this and would rather wait out a real conversation if she is to ever confide anything at all. "I
			generally consider apologies to be relevant when there are actual things to apologize for. They're not like
			candy, treats that you give to fussy kids just because it'll help their odd moods. Makes sense that Shape
			would confide in you, a lovely friend you have there. Quite enjoyable. You could learn a thing or two from
			him, about being a pleasant person who is fun to talk to." Silver takes a note to not block the number, like
			she intended to.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"The only child here is you," she mumbles. "A child would demand someone to leave them to their candy. A
			child would cry and make demands that way, like you do, and try to keep foul secrets. You think you're
			better than me. No matter. Have you been properly acquainted to Shape? I know everything you could desire to
			know. He's not all he's hyped to be." She takes more of her now cold food in, and mutes the microphone for
			this. She's finding something out of this other than information, at least, before she should hang up
			unsatisfied.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver sighs audibly. "I don't know what your deal is, girlie, but you're surprisingly petulant for a
			blogger. I thought those generally strived to be popular in some sense. I'll do my own research on Shape in
			due time, so please keep this a spoiler free zone. So far, my choices of interaction seem to be him and you,
			and you seem less appealing let alone a choice, considering you've already threatened to roleplay as a
			marketing caller with your various phones. I'll give you one more snide comment, and I'll then push the red
			button on my phone that makes me not have to listen to you anymore. Unless you want to offer some actually
			useful insight instead."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Well, the organic yerba mate I posted about in my lifestyle blog must keep me focused." She grins to
			herself. Not to be seen. She doesn't dwell on the insults other than that about popularity, where she says,
			"Anyone can be popular if they manipulate the intentions of the people around them. I just ask questions. I
			have nothing useful to tell you anymore, since you have nothing useful to tell me in exchange, however you
			should consider cultivating a heart, something full of vesicles people come with. I can lack one too." Vera
			decides to end the call, and she removes her plate from her bed with a headache.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver drops the phone onto the sofa, where it lands face down with a soft 'pufh' sound. She unmutes the
			television to the middle of some straight person rom-com movie that somehow is still more intriguing that
			what had just transpired. She'll soon have a late night meal as she is, in fact, in need of actual
			nutrients. And then try to sleep through processing all of what has happened today. What a hassle.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			--------------------
		<p>
			A few days later, Vera Hanley initiates another step of her plan she outlined. She brought in her sash her
			tablet, pocket Taser, and a tool more commonly given to the Town enforcers. She has protective measures and
			strategies for Silver's unknown magic. And she knocks on the door of the house that Silver has to her name
			corresponding to the geolocation of the phone. Silver was, unfortunately, not very traceable beyond this.
			Her name is a metal.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Visitors, so soon? Maybe a neighbor who insists on saying hi. Or maybe Shape. The very thought that it could
			be Vera doesn't cross Silver's mind until the door is already open. Very must have been looking directly at
			Silver to catch the generic, inviting smile melt off her face instantly.
		<p>
			"You."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Hey again. I may have brought a housewarming gift, but I had no knowledge if the tradition was in your
			cultural background." Vera tries to enter the house, stepping beside Silver. "Let's just keep it
			professional. I can't convince you to say anything you don't want to say, after all." Vera is speaking
			louder than last time.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver does not object to Vera passing in any way, but interjects. "Awfully bold of you to step into my
			territory. I'd be concerned about going headfirst into the house of a supposed witch... Apologies.
			Professional sounds good. Make yourself comfortable, the living room is to the left." She closes the door
			behind them both. If Vera wants to undress and find a place to put her shoes, that's her own problem. Silver
			takes the door to the left ahead of her, rendering the comment before mostly moot.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera watches Silver's expression, and her lips, as much as she can. Silver's voice is barely audible through
			these earplugs, after all. She takes her shoes off simply at the front door, and then follows Silver closely
			into the living room and says, "There's a first time for everything. If anything, I'm excited to be
			somewhere new with people I don't know much about." Vera sits close to wherever Silver sits or stands, and
			she retrieves her note device from her sash. "Anything you'd prefer me to write into the record, before I
			might ask questions? Besides that question, paradoxically."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver takes a comfortable relined position on her sofa, house shoes left on the floor, motioning to a chair
			somewhat adjacent. The result ends up looking, possibly intentionally, like a stereotypical visit to the
			psychologist. She stares up into the ceiling, partially to mask her expressions a bit and to avoid making
			eye contact. Surely, this will make matters more complicated for Vera.
		<p>
			"Oh, I still do not know exactly what you're aiming to achieve so I don't actually know where to start. No,
			Silver is not my real birth name and I have a last name too. But I've made it such a pervasive method of
			referring to me that those will lead you to less success than just trying to find information about Silver."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah. Withheld, in the pursuit of knowledge, we take stabs in the dark. It is not always clear what we're
			aiming to pin with precision." She types some notes, and keeps her eyes steady on Silver's lips. She sits up
			a bit taller to see them when Silver faces up like this. "Perhaps we should start with the information about
			yourself that you're comfortable sharing. For example, your chosen alias is Silver; however, what is your
			age, what is your college reading level?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I generally try to be a pleasant conversationalist partner for these reasons. People simply keep talking
			when you give them a good arena to do so. And relevant things will come up eventually, especially if you ask
			the right things."
		<p>
			Silver has to make sure she doesn't allude to her... Techniques too much.
		<p>
			"I like to joke that one shouldn't ask a lady her name, I think you have more potentially important reasons
			to note it down. So... 29 years. A good number. As for reading level, I don't know your weird numbering and
			descriptive systems so I'll simply say that it's more than sufficient for any and all purposes. I know
			words."
		<p>
			"When you say 'write into the record', what record may this be anyhow?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			An interesting thing to highlight how people can bleed information, although Vera suspects it could be
			because Silver is trying to remind herself. Vera tugs her dark hair aside, and she says, "29 years it is.
			And it's not common enough that I interview such literate candidates. An unusual correlation exists between
			people living in scrapyards and resources they shouldn't have access to, for instance." In some ways, this
			pace was boring. But, given it's not an assignment, she lets herself ease her way through. "It's
			confidential; however I can assure you that it is nothing to trouble yourself with. I'll inform you when
			there's an issue, and even with your powers I can't admit you're dangerous."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"You remember what I said about relevant things coming up naturally? Now you have me curious about what
			manner of interview research you have due with people possessing illegal materials. I have my suspicions
			about you too, you see. Ones actually founded in reasonable observations and conclusions..." She sighs.
			Don't become snarky again already. No need to make a whole scene out of this. "I'm very curious about this
			whole powers thing, truly. Yes, I did come across the detail that Shape has some... Unnatural leanings, but
			is this really such a commonplace thing in your life that you accuse random people of witchcraft?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"In an alternate universe, I'm sure you're the one working my job. In this one, I prefer to be more matter
			of fact in my role. You're right to believe that subtle encouragement can reveal more information than
			originally intended. Maybe you're wrong to assume that I'm all secrets." She sighs, in return. She closes
			her eyes, and then opens then. If she was going to be anyone to talk about her job in detail with, it should
			be the career center in Town. She says, anyway, "Yeah. I am certain-- fully assured-- if I did something you
			weren't in agreement with, you'd wave me away again... Shape does have magical friends, and I've met a few.
			You're only another. Magic is imprecise, and the rules change, I find."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver sits up properly, facing Vera. This is incredibly fluffy and devoid of content, all in all. She tries
			to make eye contact. Not for magical purposes, but very deliberately.
		<p>
			"I don't see why I'm the one who deserves interrogation when you're acting like some sort of secret agent
			with magical friends who will pursue business ladies in their own home to go on the most peculiar
			philosophical tangents. I still don't know what your plan is and I'm realizing more and more that maybe I am
			the one being played here. What sort of potentially malicious intents are you up to?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera avoids Silver's eyes. It's a bit, well, childlike. "Please, Silver, I'm not a 'secret agent.' There's
			no James Bond. And I don't see why you think I'm malicious. I genuinely want to know about you in the
			pursuit of knowledge. And-- assuming you're not defending a painstaking list of evil intentions, past to
			future, how'd you like me to prove my purpose is understanding what there is to understand about you?" She
			stows her notetaking device in her sash, and she keeps her hand buried in her sash. Finding the grip on the
			Taser, and finding the electromagnetic restrainers.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I'm still quite attached to the point that you managed and decided to pursue me in my own newly obtained
			housing over the sole point that I... 'Made you leave'?"
		<p>
			Vera seems intimidated. Good. Silver moves closer, instead choosing to sit on the edge of the coffee table.
			It gives her a bit more height over Vera and closes the gap some.
		<p>
			"I want to understand, want to take you seriously, but it all makes so little sense to me. It becomes more
			and more natural to me to suppose you have deeper motives. How would you prove this, anyhow? You're all
			'confidentiality' and mystery. We both seem to be unable to get anything useful out of this for each our
			reasons, and you're acting like the part that has anything to gain from it. Who wants to gain something from
			this. I'm just trying to have a cozy day for myself."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She says, and she grits her teeth initially, "If you came across something you didn't understand, why would
			you walk away from it? Are you content living in the shadow of the truth?" And then Vera is quiet for a
			while, and her fingers play lightly on the trigger of the Taser, and she stands up slowly. "Let's assume
			you're innocent. If I'm convinced it's impossible I left on my own accord, and you're convinced you're a
			business woman with an immaculate sophistication, then what conclusion could we possibly draw? Are you going
			to paint a third party? Are you going to continue to accuse me of being wrong about my conviction, and press
			and press to convince me I am, in fact, evil?" Even standing up, Vera is shorter than Silver. It's not
			particularly close. She walks closer to the table with Silver. "I asked you how I'd prove this. I do not
			know how I would. However, I agree. This is quickly pointless-- talking to you. Maybe that's what you wanted
			to hear?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver stands up too, arms crossed across her chest. There's a threatening closeness between the two now.
			"Maybe, just maybe, I have better things to do in my life. I am a busy woman. Do you think I achieved the
			ability to causally take residence in a house like this by chasing fairytales? No, I focus on the things I
			know are fruitful. I'm getting very tired of this, and I'm getting quite tempted to having you removed from
			my house, honestly."
		<p>
			Silver pulls her phone out of her pocket, starts pressing some things on the screen.
		<p>
			"I think you'll find there's nothing really magical in making a Disturbance Call to the authorities."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"I'm a busy woman as well. And chasing fairytales is all I do. Or it comprises at least part of my days."
			Vera swiftly removes the magnetic instruments from her sash, and she slaps their sticky straps on the back
			of Silver's hands. Silver's phone screen flickers strange colors, and Silver's hands are immediately
			squeezed together in an incredibly uncomfortable and useless lock, strap to strap of the futuristic
			handcuffs. The phone drops. This brief time, Vera backs up and shows her Taser, which is a small and buzzing
			collection of metal pinpricks. "The interview isn't over until I say it's over. Are you going to use your
			magic now? Come on now, you're useless without it." She bites her lip, and glances around them, before
			checking Silver's lips again.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver swears loudly. Surprising amount of flavor for a dignified woman of her kind. He eyes briefly lock
			with Vera and there's the subtlest tingle of magical intent to her gaze... But no. It's probably not enough
			for Vera to be certain, in the moment. The phone is a good way for Silver to distract herself, as she
			stumbles back into the sofa for fair of falling over and not being able to catch herself.
		<p>
			"You're fucking deranged. You're really lucky I have a fresh backup of most of my data, I could ruin you
			legally over damage to data and still come out worse than you. This is literally what I was getting at;
			you're a madwoman with mysterious, questionable affiliations and have the fucking audacity to say I'm the
			one who's posing an issue here." She lowers her voice some, and rests her cuffed hands inconveniently in
			front of her face. "Unhand me right now, or I'll do everything in my powers to make your next while a living
			hell." She knows Vera likely won't be able to understand her, maybe. She wants to test how well those
			peculiar earplugs work, seeing what fancy technology Vera seems to possess.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera faces Silver, and she raises her eyebrow with a dash of whim. At long last, control. "You can sue me if
			you delight. You can dub me a madwoman, that's alright too. How about we simply wait here for hours? A
			working class, unthreatening, embarrassing woman like yourself is powerless in this scenario, after all.
			Since, after all, you claim to be innocent of magic. It doesn't matter if I'm alien or a wizard, what
			matters is that I have you here as long as I intend-- in an interview or staring contest. Because you're
			just a white-haired sandbag." Vera simply ignores what she is unable to hear, assured it's along the same
			lines anyway. She breathes in deeply. "So anyway. Let's keep it professional."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			Silver decides that the handcuffs are more interesting that Vera's incessant monologue. She continues
			speaking in the same tone while her face is occupied by looking at the curious device on her hands. It's
			some sort of fluffy tirade about her business contacts, about professionalism, about claiming she has so
			much patience and very few places to be anytime soon. In truth, her thoughts are an endless string of trying
			to think of how to most effectively get her one shot back at Vera. She's cuffed, and Miss Blogger has a
			Taser and some amount of ear protections. If she commits and misses, the consequences would be most dire
			indeed considering Vera's still unknown capabilities and connections.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She nods and tries watching Silver's lips and interpreting them and listening... Although, there's nothing
			to listen to, and Vera skipped the lip-reading elective in training, she just kind of skimmed through some
			of the common practices yesterday to compensate. She blinks a lot more, and she touches her own arm with her
			free hand. "Thank you... This monologue has some good information. I'll have to write this all down soon...
			Do you mind if you speak with a bit more volume, I'm hard of hearing and you want to have me leave sooner
			than later." She steps closer to the couch and cups one ear.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			A crucial mistake on Vera's part. Silver scans the earpiece that's clearly presented to her. It's... Truly
			nothing special, she's certain of that now. She moves her hands down from her face, and mouths something
			without actually making noise, each syllable defined for emphasis. No magic, but a very clear statement
			nonetheless.
		<p>
			"I can tell your bluff. Look at me, you insolent little brat."
		<p>
			She's staring intently, watching every little movement on Vera's part.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Very well. I'm not hard of hearing. And I've been looking." Vera says these statements, one after another,
			enjoying the clear enunciation portrayed on Silver's lips. "Tell me, Silver, how you inherited your vast
			fortune. Engage with me in an all-telling story about your motivators, your obstructions, your strategy."
			Vera tries to keep her eyes steady. Silver's hard gaze is perturbing the peripheral vision, however.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"I make the rules now." One last gentle mouthed note, and it's already too late.
		<p>
			Silver makes one abrupt motion, locking into Vera's eyes before she has a chance to flinch. The magical
			impact is like a psychic punch to the face as Silver yells, with every ounce of her power channeled. "You
			will obey me, Vera. Put your weapon down, remove your earpieces, and free my hands. I am your superior and
			you only act as instructed, now."
		<p>
			She pants, having exerted a good part of her voice and magic in one single action.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera cries out in return, and her eyes, for a flash of light, feel stabbed straight through with dark lasers
			and bright wires. She lets go of her Taser, in a combination of the effect and of the startle, and she rubs
			her eyes and slides back her legs against the table. However... Vera collects herself. And in very intended
			fashion, Vera takes her ear pieces off of her, throws them onto Silver's lap, and unlatches the strange
			magnetic cuffs with a bit of finesse that'd be nigh accessible to the wearer. She's gasping for stability,
			looking like she might cry. "I finally know the fucking truth. You're a witch. You're a rotten witch, and
			can make me do that."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"It could have been so very simple. You leave me the fuck alone and we don't have any issues. But you had to
			play with fire no matter how hard I tried to protect you from it. You still don't know what I am capable of.
			Unfortunately, you seem to actually matter in some way, have connections, so I can't just entirely get rid
			of you that easily." This is a deliberately vague threat. "Sit down, and tell me who you work for, why you
			are so intent on meddling with people that may pose a risk. I need to know who'd come knocking at my door if
			you didn't return to them."
		<p>
			She's both triumphant and venomously angry at the same time, rubbing her hands to soothe the discomfort of
			the device. "Whatever happens today and after is all your fault."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"I always fly close to the sun. And I flew too close." Her voice is hoarse, and she wipes a tear off of her.
			"Look, I'm all about the truth. I wasn't going to leave you alone..." With the command, Vera's authority
			over her free will is loosened. A horrible feeling. She sits down with Silver, and she says
			unenthusiastically but also weakly yet, "I work for a city called Town, and its AI. I'm a field researcher,
			and therefore it's less about stopping you and more akin to reporting." Vera pushes on Silver. Vera then
			starts digging into her own dark scalp of hair, creating an awful tangle. "This gains you nothing."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Azu_w">
		<p>
			"My entire existence, dear, is about doing my own little things that cause me to stay wealthy at expense of
			whatever uselessly rich contacts I can sway in my direction. I don't cause problems with my powers—I solve
			them. And I'm going to solve you out of my way as well, as I already tried to. But you're stubborn and
			incessant and I'm going to have to dig very deep into your mind to fix that. I like this place and I'm not
			going to move an eighth time in six years just because of you. Because unlike you, I take the low effort
			routes and simply let go of my ties when it avoids trouble."
		<p>
			"I don't understand you. I don't understand people like you. Only looking to achieve issues where there are
			none. You want a truth? I'll make my own truth, and when you find yourself at home, you will believe every
			word of what I will tell you, forgetting what actually transpired today. And what happened last time we met.
			You'll find a way to deal with any records of our phone call too; I believe you could manage that. Does all
			of that scare you? Good. Get it out while you still can, you'll be back to your uselessly oblivious self
			soon." She sighs, but in a warm kind of way. It's almost therapeutic, asserting her complete dominance after
			the stress Vera had caused.
	</div>

			Vera slumps into the couch, and her brief excitement at hearing how she probably indeed preserves her wealth
			is entirely shattered by this concept of... Making Vera believe a lie. Believing something verifiably false,
			with 100% conviction, despite being a member of the days that the truth would have been so abundantly clear.
			The only ties to the truth being the scattered notes she managed before Silver got the upper hand, and maybe
			what Town AI would know separate those calls, a shoddy story as that would be. She pulls and straightens her
			hair, then, dropping some strands on the couch.
		<p>
			She says, "Very well. I have no reason to believe anything... I wanted the truth because it's my passion. I
			love the truth. That's fundamentally why I'm a field researcher. So I'm scared Silver. I'll admit myself. I
			don't know who you are, I don't know if you've convinced me into a lie already-- I'm going to just-- be
			upset." She stops with her hair, and she stares into Silver's eyes. No reason not to now. With nothing to
			leverage, Vera is only a young adult woman, a human.

			Silver starts to feel sorry for the girl, but it's fine. It'll pass, all of this, and she will finally have
			some peace to do her things again. Shape is... honestly a rather complicating factor in this all, but it'll
			be fine. It always works out in the end for Silver, she tells herself.
		<p>
			"In some way, I admire you. In your position, I'd have bitched out so long ago, facing something I believe
			to have overpowered me and despite this let me be. You said in some universe I'd maybe have your job
			instead... That's not true. You're capable of things I would never be. Like making me feel threatened in my
			own home despite clearly being vastly superior to you."
		<p>
			"So I'll be kind, and give you the comforting version, not the one that'll leave you feeling uncertain and
			worried and distressed about the inexplicable mismatches in your brain forever. It is time for you to
			believe a new truth about who I am, your experiences with me."
		<p>
			Silver strings a story, about how Vera had been called in to some fruitless research the first time she'd
			left the cafe abruptly. About how the call had simply been a misplaced one, intended for someone else.
			Startlingly similar voice to Silver, so the confusion is understandable. About how the meeting today cleared
			up some critical misunderstandings, how they had some friendly tea and chatter together. How Vera had left
			feeling a bit dizzy and unwell, coming down with some sort of cold that will leave her lying in bed for a
			day due to an uncomfortable brain fog that makes sure to obscure all the true memories. About how Silver is,
			most undoubtedly, just a simple human.

			Vera has a hard time paying attention, but she at least takes the compliment and nods. She says, "Comforting
			it is," and the false truth is smoothly pressed into the wrinkles of her brain that are so often responsible
			for memory and assessments. She almost smiles, although not quite, when that false story is entirely told,
			including events that haven't even happened yet. And so Vera goes through the motions of the film, and
			seeing as there's no tea around either of them, Vera says, "Once more, I apologize. The circumstances were
			unusual, indeed. This meeting and conversation has been... Somewhat delightful, I appreciated the earl grey
			with cream." She blinks, and she tries to fix her hair that seems to be unkempt for some reason she doesn't
			dwell on. "If you meet something or someone that my interrogation or investigative skills could apply to,
			for no charge I'll follow through on it, Silver. I'm doing this for passion, and for the blog, not for
			service. For now, however, I must go. All the same as you, I'm a busy woman."

			"It's been lovely, miss Blogger. Do take care, and I'll let you know if there's something you may help with
			in that regard." Earl grey with cream, hm. She takes a note of that, for no real purpose. She has brushed
			away the earpieces and Vera does not recollect having brought any - it'd be awkward to return them. "We have
			so much to attend to, as busy ladies, but it's always nice to get to sit down for some time. Best of luck
			out there." She gets up, and indicates towards the door before leading Vera out.
