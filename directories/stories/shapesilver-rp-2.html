		<h1>Shape and Silver — 2</h1>
		<div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		The next day, Shape is wiping her kitchen counter with a dollop of bleach powder and soggy towel. She's decided to maintain her exaggerated height, not intending to burn through precious magical energies before the dress-up today. She has on a nightgown that fits her stature-- an irregular, soft blue one.
		<p>
		She steps away to the living room and opens the door after it’s been knocked, not even checking through the peephole. She didn't anticipate her at a specific hour, but Silver seemed the type to come by morning than late afternoon. "Morning!" 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		It's indeed morning, though not overly so. Getting Shape out of bed early and having to deal with some morning grouchiness was a real concern of Silver, so she'd made sure to run some errands and business in the early hours to pass some time first. She eyes up her peer - The nightgown makes her think she's still too early, but no. Shape seems too bright and awake to have been stirred by the knocking. 
		<p>
		"Good morning to you too. I do hope this is an opportune time for us to get started? If you need some amount of minutes I'll happily sit with a cup of tea."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		She says, "Yeah, this is a good time. I already ate and was just kinda cleaning up a bit before you arrived; I'll finish tidying up the house in the evening. That being said, I'll make you some tea anyway. I've got like-- ten different ones. I remember last time Nina got us like a raspberry tea or something? I could do that if you want, or a different fruity tea." She darts off to the kitchen to boil a plastic kettle. "So, uh, how was last night after I left?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Take your pick of tea, dear. Today will test your decision making skills so consider it a warmup." She invites herself into the house, and makes way to the living room. It's a bit well windy out, so she'd rather not stay in the doorway. "It was uneventful. Generic financial numbers." She didn't need to mention checking in with some deeply charmed individuals for valuable insider information she should not under any means have access to.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Mystery fruit tea it is." She pours a mug of hot water and drops a tea bag of lemon ginger, and she takes it to the living room table. The noir board game from the last week is nowhere to be found, replaced by a cork drink coaster. Shape sits and folds her legs. "That's fair. I just hugged my pillow... So, Stylist, what sort of decisions did you have in mind? After having thought it over a tiny-yy bit, I mostly just realized I wanted to jab at Jae-eun with my 'casual outfit.' Make her feel a bit inadequate, if you know what I mean."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"We can certainly achieve that, dear. I could make you seem more wealthy and professional than you are, if you don't mind. Oh, and for bare foundations. Are you still looking to humor your feminine side today? And in general, your current frame. I know you've had your variances in that aspect so I must ask." She waits on the liquid to cool. It's a shame you can't convince tea in the way you would people. She's had to make people 'cool off' way too many times.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		She smiles, and rubs her thumbs together. "I'd love to look wealthy and professional in front of Jae-eun, and doubling as an outfit I can pull for later anyhow. Awesome. Yeah, I want to stay a lady and tall, it kind of works well into intimidating Jae-eun as well but also I didn't want to burn out some of my energy we could use for adjusting clothes instead." She glances at her own reflection in the shut-off television flat-screen, and she says, "I also just am a lady lately."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"That does make sense. You make a wonderful lady, Shape. Emphasizing and elevating that aspect we can certainly focus on. I think... A skirt is certainly in order. Nothing too excessive, a proper business casual, but it can't be too secretary either. You're meant to seem successful, not an asset to others. I won't go overboard though, else Jae-eun may pry and wonder why she hasn't heard of your wealth and fame yet." Silver takes out a small notebook and jots down these notes. "There's colors... I'm not sure a strikingly monochrome would work with your brown hair. Something more delicate, soft in nature rather. Going along with the browns seems good, and you have your beige leanings already."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"That's definitely the nicest thing you've said about me," She says softly. She leans back. "You really do have a good knack for this. I can already tell this is going to be wonderful working with you. If you have more questions maybe to guide it, let me know, but I really like the idea of a skirt that's not too quaint or too excessive and the idea of a palette of browns and beiges. I'm curious how we'll capitalize on those colors, Stylist Silver." She sometime then snaps her fingers, and she says, "Oh, I should mention, Jae-eun basically used to be famous, even like a popstar for one point. Should I try and be trendy too, or nah? I'm kind of just a sack of bones, really."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Trendy does require you to play the part; I think being a bit too busy and important to have time for the newest trends on the street is an easier role to fill. And does explain our company better as well. We might just as much be business partners, to Jae-eun." 
		<p>
		Silver sketches out a very rough first idea, and offers it to Shape. A blouse covered by a somewhat cropped jacket, a skirt to above the knees and leggings. Blouse labeled with pale beige or white, leggings in beige, and the jacket/skirt in a medium brown. 
		<p>
		"That's a first idea, at the least. Oh, and a fashionable purse can't be amiss."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Hah, yeah-- Jae-eun's totally going to think we work together as business partners. Maybe I won't act trendy, no, but I'll definitely act the part of all business. Sounds fun." Shape studies the sketch for longer than a few seconds, rendering a depiction in her visual imagination. She closes her eyes and changes purely her outfit to be compatible to Shape's interpretation. So she has the reasonable blouse, leggings, skirt, jacket, and purse combination now-- the blouse chosen to be white and the purse chosen to be a bit glittery and matching beige to her leggings. "How close is this to what you were thinking?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver is again, quite charmed by the process of magic that renders Shape now... Certainly dressed, that's for sure. Silver can't help but be amused. "The core idea is certainly good, but... I'd refuse to pay a tailor if they made you something like this. We have much details to fix. It's a good attempt though! I need you to stand up so I can get a... Thorough inspection of details. I can't let you go out with a potentially catastrophic butt of skirt." She's already taking plenty of notes on seams, cuts, hues. "Also, that purse is a good one but. Half as much glitter, maybe. You can have some, as a treat, but that's too much."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		She laughs and says, "We have all morning." She stands from the couch and rotates her outfit for Silver like some kind of fashion runway star, but more neurotic. "Fine. Half glitter it is. And yeah, some other stuff I guess you're getting to."
		<p>
		...Several minutes later, Shape adjusts the seam on her skirt once again and slightly darkens the color of her jacket. It's been several slight adjustments, but thankfully most of the adjustments were one or two-time fixes; however, a few have been harder to visualize for Shape to Silver's thinking and so were more of a crapshoot. She takes a deep breath, and she walks around the table slowly. "Alright... How does this hug my waist now when I move? Does everything else look perfect? I got at least a few more dashes of magic left in me..."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"That's pretty good. We could spend an hour more on this if you had the power, but really we'd be going in circles around perfection more so than achieving it. I consider this successful, presentable, stylish even." She leans in again to browse the finer details, which now most importantly seem quite realistic. She's gotten a good, comprehensive understanding of Shape's... shape, in the process. Being able to shift into such an attractive and impressive feminine build is a thing many would envy. "I'd be ready to go any moment now."
