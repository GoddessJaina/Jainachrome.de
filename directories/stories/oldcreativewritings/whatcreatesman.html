	<h1>What Creates Man (250 Words)</h1>
	<p>
		Man suspects the heavens created man. The angels agree, and angels find that idea in the Library. I visited the
		Library, when that foreign compulsion sometimes arose, but I noticed the others would often sneer, even call the
		Library and its scripture "bible school." I consider them as I sail inches past the edge of the purple Pacific
		and reach a hard stop. A rural people's city is beyond the spruce trees. A couple of months ago, the heavens
		ushered me on a raft four feet above sea level with a pike and helmet, alongside other boats, with the intention
		we battle opposing angels.
	<p>
		I dare not venture into town center, so I hike to a home. The lopsided bench lining the wall is a reminder of
		the culture home had. Handiwork, after all, is imperfect and warm. Daniela, a friend, strung a string hat like
		that based on a human's. I adorn it, although it limps since before any archers armed, row to row. I sit on the
		bench, but I then find the front door and knock.
	<p>
		A tired, elderly man punches the door open, sending me some steps back. He sneers, "Last thing I want is an
		angel! All the craze here. Sick of 'em; sick of the oh-so-great solicitors. Can't help you people." I say,
		swollen from war and stiff, "I am here for myself. I desire rest, sir." He tilts his head and steps back too.
