	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			Miss Ashley Stirling stirs in a king-sized bed. When they open their eyes, with the memories of the night
			crashing back, with the very lovely bedroom with a fine layer of lavender paint on all walls and modern
			interior, they find the bedroom alien and yet seemingly groomed to them. Like, there are sleek and dark
			cabinets and a computer desk with a finely-tuned chair. Has Mania pimped their decor? Well, no. There's more
			space in this room than the entirety of Ashley's apartment, and there's a window that, from their bed, only
			has scattering of skyscrapers against the sky. Mania is nowhere to be seen, but the edges of Ashley's vision
			recede the last of the dark cloud.
		<p>
			They really, really want coffee, and there's no kettle or coffee machine here.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Ash slowly accustoms her vision to her surroundings, confusion and discomfort settling in more and more with
			each little observation. The bed is much comfortable though, and their silken nightgown is very pleasant
			too. There's a three minute segment of trying to reason this into being a dream or not, and the verdict
			unfortunately lands on this being reality. Slowly slinking out of bed, she places herself in the office
			chair by the computer and taps in the password. Ashley has never used that password before, and is startled
			by how natural it fell to her fingers.
		<p>
			"Ugh, why do I crave coffee? I'm not even a coffee person. I think? Maybe... Maybe not. I'll give it a try."
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The computer greets her with about ten open tabs and an email client. And, to their horror, their inbox is
			flooded with dozens of emails from just the last night. And, interestingly, not a single one of them appears
			to be spamâ€”they are all addressed to her. Perhaps that's the end of the grocery store membership card
			emails, at least...
		<p>
			Before Ashley can settle in to seeing the contents of the emails in detail or anything other than the first
			open tab being a login to some sort of corporate web portal, the phone on their desk vibrates the dark wood
			material. It's definitely not their phone, but she knows the password for it, too, and knows she's meant to
			pick it up.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			There's something clearly wrong, but Ashley knows she has to play along for now. They've idly taken in some
			movies on the matter, and need to make time to figure things out before things get out of hand. They pick up
			the call, gently resting their phone between their head and shoulder so they can continue browsing emails
			with both hands.
		<p>
			"Miss Stirling, hello?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Madrigal_w">
		<p>
			"Hey, so I was going to send you my list of candidates for the missing position in the third design group
			but unfortunately I got tangled in your other request to probe a contract with the retail distributor in
			Alaska? They were not biting, pretended like they didn't even know who we are, so I had to setup a
			presentation for them even though I guarantee you they're just playing stupid. I hate them. So should I work
			on the candidates and postpone the presentation to the evening or tomorrow?"
		<p>
			The woman talks over any of their oohs and aahs. They hear mild background conversation zip past her, and
			the echo of her hallway. It's sort of giving them a headache, nothing coffee couldn't fix. The emails are
			sometimes similar questions, all worded immaculately, one of them being noticeably of the same subject line
			as the woman's on the phone, from "Bailey Madrigal." Some other emails are stranger, suggesting they want
			assets or shares Ms. Stirling has and offering her their own shares or assistance.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Oh god. Dream big... Ashley ponders back to the things the overly inappropriate demon that swims in her mind
			had said. She'd been hired? Is this their job now? Pieces are starting to line up and the answers are not
			pleasant.
		<p>
			"Send the presentation first. I'll need some... time to be ready for the applications anyhow. It's one of
			those mornings, and I need some coffee. I trust you to figure things out."
		<p>
			Ashley opens the email, trying to find some more information on this Bailey. And information in general.
			This ache for coffee is almost sickening, in how unfamiliar but pervasive it is.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Madrigal_w">
		<p>
			"Jesus, alright, I'll get you coffee." She hangs up.
		<p>
			Reading more of the email and similar emails sent prior from Ms. Madrigal, it's pretty clear she's Ms.
			Stirling's primary secretary, specifically tasked with their most personal requests and helping guide or
			even coerce the rest of the senior executive team just under... them. In fact, as they finally get in print
			on a separate email from a Chinese interested party, Ms. Stirling is the CEO of this place, this "Excalibur"
			Incorporated. And this company apparently sells... knives and lasers, to retail, other corporate, and maybe
			government...
		<p>
			They hear a door crack open in the adjacent room. Bailey calls in their direction, spitting in seconds,
			"Your coffee! Same as always. Anything else?" The CEO hears the ceramic mug sit.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Throwing what seems to be a bit of a presentable overcoat over their nightgown, they head over to the other
			room. Sizing up their supposed Secretary. Ash feels terrible, and realizes it's best to let that show, if
			nothing than to try to garner some pity from the secretary. She takes the mug, pinching the bridge of their
			nose slightly and sighing deeply. "Apologies if that came across as demanding. Something is wrong... What's
			on the schedule today, Bailey? My head is a mess. I might have to cancel some meetings."
		<p>
			A CEO, huh. That's certainly quite a raise from being unemployed. More and more details that come up seem
			eerily familiar, as if this is somehow their life and has been. And still, it's such an uncomfortable fit.
			This isn't what they were looking for, and their past... well, memory-past, not CEO-past, has left them with
			heavy biases against people like... Themselves, in their current state. The presumably rich elite.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Madrigal_w">
		<p>
			Bailey raises her eyebrow and walks back to close the door she came in from, locking it. And she approaches
			her boss again with a folder, and opens it. What is it with folders? "These were on schedule today.
			Fortunately for you, you weren't in a particular meeting today; you were mostly requested to check the
			internal work in the research laboratory to your specifications. Might have forgot then it was Tuesday? But
			uh. Don't apologize to me. Something does seem wrong. Why are you..?" She addresses Ashley's nightgown in
			her executive office. "I can arrange someone to check your temperature and give you meds, if you like."
		<p>
			Still, Ms. Stirling's memory-past had somehow more reality than this world. Something about this reality was
			shadowy, only still coming together. They, for instance, can't remember their last lunch as well as they can
			in their memory-past. Their harry potter movie rewatch still was waiting.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Tuesday? It most definitely was Friday yesterday. Whatever was going on, it was bad, really bad.
			World-changingly so. And a certain Maria was responsible for it. Demonic and with the power to alter
			reality? Ashley was in some deep shit.
		<p>
			They eye over the folder, taking note of the sleek logo for Excalibur. At least their CEO-self had good
			taste in design, or at least in which designers to hire. "I'll see if I can get my bearings with just some
			coffee, but if it persists I'll take you up on that offer. I'll have to see when I can take the time for
			that research on a day that is not today, I hope that doesn't get too much in the way of their scheduling.
			Tell them to have the time off if they can't fit something else in the timeframe. Or if they really want to
			anyways. This one's on me."
		<p>
			They scan over the office, trying to get some more insight but just seeming even more out of shape and
			slightly bewildered while doing so.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Madrigal_w">
		<p>
			Bailey seems quiet for a moment. She produces her own phone, then, and shrugs at her. And she calls off the
			research lab progress check-in and quality assurance from Ms. Stirling herself. The engineers and scientists
			go ahead and take the time off, not really minding one way or the other why, and a few stick around for
			measurements and a scientific paper. And then Bailey thanks them and hangs up. She just stares at her boss
			drinking coffee with her sugar and cream. Like Miss Sterling hasn't worked here nearly every day for the
			past couple years. "Is there something you're looking for? Look, it's my job to attend to your problems at
			your discretion... I'm going to go ahead and call up that nurse, though. Just call me." She starts toward
			the office door.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Ashley doesn't comment, and just nods along. Once she's finally alone, she returns to her room and falls
			face first onto her bed. This is all a lot to take in, and there's so many expectations they have not a
			single clue how to fulfill yet. Despite their best efforts, it seems the secretary has already assumed them
			terribly sick and maybe some amount of spontaneously deranged. Which wouldn't be too wrong from her
			perspective, Ash supposes. Meetings, tech research to attend to.
		<p>
			The first manner of order would be to get properly dressed and scan through the office for anything of
			valuable personal information. A diary would be a godsend but they weren't one to write one, generally. But
			for now, lying face down in the bed and moping seems to do the trick. The coffee was surprisingly a taste
			their body tolerates, and the more indirect effects of caffeine are setting in. Is this what dependency is
			like? Probably.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			It's a quiet several minutes. Reality itself may be different, and they may be the figurehead of the wealth
			disparity of the country they so criticized before, but the bed is warm and soft. They're still Miss
			Stirling in their close quarters all the same. Ashley. Ashley Stirling.
		<p>
			But the nurse unlocks the office with a key she was handed from the secretary, and she locks it behind her.
			She rolls a cart and table with several over-the-counter medications and shiny medical equipment into the
			center of the office and then the bedroom. "Executive Stirling, please, feel free to make yourself
			comfortable in your bed. What symptoms did you wake up with this morning?" She's older than the executive or
			the secretary by a couple decades, and she's blonde, tall, and soft-spoken.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			As requested, Ashley sits up in a more proper manner, as proper as she can manage in this state. "It's...
			Hard to explain. Not to make this seem overly dramatic, but. There's this sense of not being quite myself,
			you see? I wake up, I check my phone, but despite knowing how to do these things it doesn't feel familiar.
			I'm having a hard time even remembering how exactly the 'usual' Miss Stirling acts."
		<p>
			She realizes that this ramble sounds absolutely odd but there's maybe some underlying misplaced hope that
			somehow, the nurse knows more than she should. Ash sighs, deeply. "Maybe it's just some manner of stress
			reaction, who knows. I just worry what might happen if this persists."
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The nurse nods her head and scribbles some of these described symptoms or theories onto the clipboard on the
			top of the cart. She's closed the door to the bedroom, and she says, "I see... You're displaying symptoms
			such as detachment, memory loss, a general lack of enthusiasm, anxiety... I think your hunch is a strong
			candidate, and you're experiencing great stress. So much is expected from you and it's grown exponentially
			in the past year alone. Please, Executive Stirling, how do you usually act, if you can recall? And how do
			you feel right now, if we haven't discussed that fully? Is it different from how you have felt a few months
			ago?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Ashley scratches their head quite decisively. Trying to reawaken whatever lingering memories might be in the
			physical part of her brain. Trying to "recollect" things that she for all intents and purposes never knew.
			"I feel, overwhelmed mostly. As if I've rediscovered my status and position all anew. As if it just now
			clicked with me that I'm the CEO of a large company, that I have so much responsibility, and I never was
			quite aware of this before..." It's not a lie, truly, any of this. But it's very much not a direct
			explanation either.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			"I see..." She says again. She stands more to their bedside, dragging the cart with her, and she rummages
			through the labels and pill bottles. She blinks as she writes something else hasty, and she faces them. "I
			will run this by our network soon. But I'm confident what you are experiencing, Executive Stirling, is very
			treatable and common among young professionals at all levels of society. You will be back to your normal
			self in a few days, most likely, if you give yourself some time to reflect and relax. I know it's hard, but
			you could really need it." The nurse pauses. She holds up a needle. The Excalibur logo shines on the base of
			the metal, where it's much wider. "We should take a blood sample as well. Do you have anything else you'd
			want to tell me?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			There's no real reason to object, and if anything was physically wrong with this new and yet familiar body,
			it would be in her best interest to find out anyhow. So she drops off her overcoat and pushes back the
			sleeve on her nightgown, offering it to the nurse. "I... Think that's it. Hard to say for sure, of course,
			with my state. If anything serious comes up I'll have Bailey... Miss Madrigal note you. Thank you for your
			efforts. I'll try to limit my hours, certainly. I have competent people to rely on, I suspect."
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The nurse places a thin, protective, square, transparent patch over the large vein she intends to poke the
			needle into, and she then lines the needle and does so. Stirling feels an almost disturbingly minimal tug of
			the skin, the smallest blister of sensation, as the needle breaks through their skin and recedes out once
			the vial is filled with the red stuff. And the nurse bandages the spot, over the patch. "Of course,
			Executive. It's the job. But, you know our number if Miss Madrigal needs to get in contact with us again,
			yes. Enjoy the fruits of your labor for now." The nurse carts out of the room with the vial placed in a
			zippy bag, the tip of the needle places in a medical cloth. And she's left in the dimly lit bedroom alone
			once again.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			It makes sense that Excalibur has an expertise in research and sharp objects, and Ashley thanks whatever
			process that lead them here for at least acknowledging their appeals and interests. It's astounding how
			precise this Excalibur brand implement is, and she can't help but be impressed. Did she really achieve this,
			in this other life? In a twisted sense, she's proud of herself. Dream big.
		<p>
			And still, the deep pit in their stomach opens again once they're done playing theatrics for unknowing
			onlookers. They didn't ask for this, they're not built to be a businessperson with probably limited regard
			for others. Bailey's reaction was pretty telling, it seems the CEO Ashley was a bit of a dick... What even
			happened to them, when unemployed Ash took over? This is a weird existential thread they refuse to go down
			right now, actually.
		<p>
			They get dressed. They're not at all familiar with this expensive and stylish business attire but the
			process of putting it on is second-hand natural motions. If only memories were so quick to be in place,
			they'd have this much more insight.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The outfit is tasteful, at least. Consisting of a light gray skirt, white blouse, and proper gray vest.
			Seeing themselves in the bedroom's full-body mirror is most assuring that they at least look the part in it.
			It tempts a smile.
		<p>
			It's habitual to check her emails in this reality, although she can quit at any time she reminds herself.
			The client has already updated with a dozen emails from last time, including a notice about when the medical
			information is projected to returnâ€”a couple days from now unless something serious came from one of the
			tests that completes sooner. Miss Stirling knows she's meant to update her senior executive team about her
			status for the next few days, though, and makes that the focus, creating the subject body for such an email.
			However, there is an email that comes in during this process. The subject line reads, "Hey it's Nole From
			Economics!" Not only was there a Nole from Economics for this Ashley Stirling, but Ashley was sure the guy
			she was adjusted to from economics in her original life's college was also called Nole.
		<p>
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Nole... Nole. Nole the economics guy. So college might have been mostly the same still, they note, and pin
			another red thread to the growing noticeboard in their brain. Disregarding all the work related emails feels
			uncomfortable, but there might be interesting details to find from this Nole so she opens it up to scour for
			information.
		<p>
			Well, after completing the internal notice, of course.
		<p>
			> Just a heads up, unforeseen circumstances have gotten in the way and I'll be less able to respond to or
			participate in business matters for a few days forward. I put my trust in you, and I'll want proper reports
			on anything that happens outside of my usual direct supervision.
		<p>
			> Ashley Stirling
			<br>
			> CEO
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			Nole's email is polite and unprofessional. Instead, Nole is requesting that him and her get in contact with
			one another again sometime over the phone or maybe even in person. He happens to live in Stirling's city, on
			the outskirts. Not too remarkable since the college they went to is also of this state, but nevertheless a
			nice coincidence. He leaves his phone number as well, and he clarifies that he's "ecstatic they went so far
			with their passion and their career" and how he remembers them just in a study group together slacking off
			and sometimes even putting a movie on.
		<p>
			When they check their other tabs, it's a slew of scientific articles, their last bank statement, and a
			restaurant menu. The scientific articles aren't all from Excalibur, actually, many from outside university
			work. Her lab workers probably sent her this.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			There's no way to tell if this is a good idea or a terrible idea. But the itch to work despite already
			having called off for the time being could do with a real distraction. In hindsight, she doesn't even know
			when she woke up today - It's only 9 am? She's definitely been up for at least an hour. Fucking hell. That's
			the business life, she supposes.
		<p>
			Ashley has vague own memories of watching movies with Nole. It was mostly generic popular content, some
			documentaries. Being able to connect with him might be a good way to stabilize and still gain insight from
			the time that's diverged. She types out a response.
		<p>
			> Hi, Nole.
			<br>
			> As you can imagine, I am a very busy lady generally. But you're in luck; I have a bit of an unusual
			opening the next few days. Apologies if this is a bit of a short notice, but how does a chat at...
		<p>
			Ashley has to make sure the place she is thinking of still exists in this timeline. A quick search says it
			does. Okay, good, she's not making a complete lunatic out of herself this time.
		<p>
			> ...CafÃ© Soleil, tomorrow at noon, sound? I haven't reminisced enough on the past lately.
		<p>
			> Ashley Stirling
			<br>
			> CEO, Excalibur
		<p>
			Actually, she erases that last line. The formality sits seep in their fingers but it just feels out of place
			here.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The email is sent. And since Nole's email was only sent a couple minutes prior, there's a quick and pleasant
			response.
		<p>
			> Thank you!
			<br>
			> I look forward to connecting again at the cafe. I'm really honored you have time for me in that life. I'll
			see you then!
		<p>
			> Nole
		<p>
			Still, the day is early, there is more coffee to be had in several hours, and this is tomorrow they are
			talking about meeting. Stirling's attention drifts toward the scientific work on nanotechnology and
			micromaterials on the tab. Certainly, in this timeline, they have much more work and expertise than even a
			bit of university. The snippets of memory here sometimes include borderline obsession, times spent dusk to
			dawn trying to design perfect cutlery, and then funding through a research grant physically, precisely,
			creating them. And then marketing them and dropping out, like anyone who's become above the intended
			education and career path. Dream big. Surpassing every expectation, and pushing people to get there,
			including themselves.
		<p>
			In any case, Stirling can now comfortably order food delivery anytime she wants, and she's feeling lunch.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Ashley scans through the phone, for apps. Food delivery services are of course on the list. They scan
			through some of the backlogs, trying to get some sense of what manner of meals they have partaken in the
			last few weeks. They order something lighter off this list, since their appetite is still being rivalled by
			the deeply unsettling and unhappy feelings. Bailey gets a small phone message.
		<p>
			Lunch delivery will be here in about twenty minutes. Tell front desk to send it to my office when it
			arrives. -Ashley
		<p>
			The memories are intriguing, and Ash closes her eyes to try to invite more of it... Cutlery, huh. Makes
			sense. Shaping of metal, precision, sharpness. She's not sure where she'd have that money and support though
			- Oh, ugh. Surely her family enjoyed this version of Miss Stirling becoming a businessperson with large
			aspirations. They had resources, after all, to kickstart her if they had actually cared to in the other
			time. So this wasn't even truly a self-made wealth, probably, they'd likely been coasting off family funds.
			Sigh.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The consequence of fortune early in life is sitting too pretty from the start... Sure, the university
			granted funds for her expert initiatives, but Ashley was struggling with a job and college in her original
			life. It's much the reason she never progressed into university there. Here... Well, she had no memory of
			working cashier or food line. Just college, just young experiences, just this research and fondness for the
			sharp objects andâ€”in universityâ€”nanomaterials and optics.
		<p>
			Worse, their parents met with them after their first distribution online. And it was the most proud and
			joyous they've been, in any timeline. Their vision of a successful daughter was realized. Of course... They
			grew distant. Seeing but less than annually. But, in a way, the "high" from their pride never went away.
			Their relationship to her became... symbolic. Bragging rights.
		<p>
			Executive Stirling felt smug, thinking about it. Sometime later, her lunch arrives to her office in the hand
			of an intern knocking the door.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Reliving these foreign memories is incredibly eerie, but the sense of actual insight and knowledge is in
			itself much more comforting than being entirely lost and basically being an acting amnesiac from this day
			on. So... Food. She takes quick look in the mirror to be at least passable in expression despite her
			stressed and terrible state, and then enters her office to accept the lunch with a throwaway comment of
			appreciation before seeing them off and closing the door again. Making sure it's locked, of course. They sit
			down at the office desk, and rummage a bit through the drawers in between. Familiarizing themselves with
			locations of trivial office objects in case they might need them later.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			There's a couple objects of note: a keychain with a few keys, including a Bluetooth car key; a set of gray
			ball-point ink pens of varying thickness; a black wallet with a few more credit cards than a sane person
			would own; a passport; and the most incredible custom switch knife. The edges of the blade, on close
			inspection, are serrated in an almost alien design. And different protrusions of the finely-toothed design
			are varying colors of gray and even purple. Stirling, eventually, remembers that this is one of their latest
			experimental designs, not even demonstrated yet to an interested manufacturer or national hospital. And of
			course, the symbol of Excalibur is there again on the cool handle. A sword, both abstracted into shapes and
			yet composed and inspiring. It always points toward a circle of light.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Ashley takes a credit card out, and gently lets her hand guide itself. It instinctively traces out the
			muscle memory motion of typing a keypad, 7-6-1-4. So that's her code, apparently.
		<p>
			Good. She has access to her money. She puts the card back, making sure it's the front one for easy access
			and not taking one of the many others instead. The knife, she twists and inspects and is honestly in great
			awe of. This is the kind of thing she'd dream of as a student with a fascination for pointy things. There's
			a strong urge to find a random object to try with it, and she settles on pulling out an empty plastic folder
			from one of her cabinets.
		<p>
			It splits in half with an almost seductive grace. Mmm.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The knife leaves an impression that few materials are safe.
		<p>
			After they've finished eating and having some water, and all the drawers have been examined for interesting,
			non-work content... Ashley is left again to her thoughts, and the executive aspects of her feel almost
			stuffy without something to scratch the itch of her familiar leadership. The days of drinking tea and
			thinking of nothing at all for a few minutes, unless they can convince the demoness to give her old life
			back, are over. Her compulsion to check the computer returns, but she tries to shove the idea away for now.
			She remembers that she has a sense of fun and indulgence in this universe as well through some examples.
			They remember that travel in the past couple years, business-inspired but also leisure. She remembers using
			her fortune, as much as her fame in enterprise, to inspire strange bedfellowsâ€” often not in good faith.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Surfacing thoughts of action in bed that she can't even consider her own? Now that's quite awkward. And just
			a little bit hot to think back at. With the variety of girls she's bedded, there's surely been some or other
			celebrity news mention about her having possible partners or not. But that's really not what she's looking
			for - Probably the entire world knows she's gay though, as a result.
		<p>
			She can't tell if the tingly feeling in her stomach is from just how sexy this knife is, or if it's the more
			potent memories of bedding people. Oh well, no time to dwell on that. She'll surely get her real share of
			that eventually, if she desires. They've dug into some of their lunch, it's good food and it somewhat
			dispels the feelings that tried to void her appetite. Maybe having money isn't so bad... Ugh. It's not even
			been half a day and she worries about becoming complacent. Who knows where she'll be in a week if this
			continues.
