			Bailey sighs and presses into the executive's office with a small tray of cookies. She closes her eyes and
			passes the tray atop a countertop aside the main workspace, which is empty save for a couple knives out of
			their shelves. She creaks the door open to the bedroom, and she says, “I've seen your email, and I've seen
			the nurse's evaluation. You're not the first person I've worked for that became stressed, although I think
			you might have had the worst reaction—no offense, please, Miss Stirling. You're still handling things well.
			And your staff will manage... Ms. Mica in the retail department sent you chocolate cookies if you wish,
			they're by the fridge.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Chocolate cookies do sound very appealing currently. Ms. Mica... Something about the name unlocks good brain
			chemicals in Ashley's head. She supposes that said Ms. Mica is just a very likeable and good person then.
			"Do send her my thanks, and thank you too for bringing them. I do trust in the staff to do well without me
			for now. I kind of have to, after all. But Excalibur certainly makes good things and it's been a group
			effort." They don't take any offense, considering the situation is indeed much worse than Bailey would know
			or ever understand. "Considering I've already called off all my attendance, I do suppose I should take a
			trip outside. Get some fresh air, and some motion. The last thing I'd want to do is waste away in my room.
			I'll have a cookie first, of course." Ashley stands up and stretches, having already spent a bit too long in
			bed again... She has a slight itch building. Taking time off as a CEO seems to be more difficult than one
			would suppose.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Madrigal_w">
		<p>
			“She'll be delighted to know. And, yes, Excalibur is many moving, carefully collaborating components and an
			industry giant.” Miss Madrigal steps back from the door and then leans against the wall. “Well, Executive,
			wouldn't that pretty much be a conflict of interest with Nurse Emily's recommendations? I agree that you
			should not simply be in your bed the whole time; however, I think it's sometimes stressful, actually, to
			show your face in this city. Should we reserve a private flight to somewhere a little farther instead?
			Consider it an insisted company retreat?” Her gaze glides up to the ceiling LED, and she kicks her heel up
			on her other shoe. “Anyway, please, have as many cookies as you need. You're fond of them... I'm thinking an
			island, though.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			"I already have a personal meeting scheduled tomorrow so I can't exactly travel far away. You do raise a
			point, but fresh air does still appeal much to me. I'll simply keep to myself and ignore the weirder ones.
			If things go less than preferred I'll be back sooner." She stands and evaluates her outfit. It's very smart
			and business-y, maybe a bit too much for a casual outing. They have no idea what manner of replacements
			would be in the closet, but it'd be worth a look- God, taking a trip to an island appeals more than it
			should, truly. But she can't do that to poor Nole, and barring more thorough flashbacks to her alternate
			past she wouldn't learn much just resting among any palm trees.
		<p>
			"We could go to an island some other time. I don't want to lose too much familiarity with my surroundings in
			this state, either." She does finally approach the cookies, sitting down in their office chair and carefully
			savoring the chocolatey flavor. Mmm.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Madrigal_w">
		<p>
			Bailey laughs. “Excuse me, then. The 'personal meeting' hopefully will not have anything to do with
			Excalibur, then, and perhaps we'll see how you feel about getting out of this place after the meeting. Enjoy
			yourself, CEO.” She takes a tall, glass bottle of water from the fridge and pours some of it into a sleek
			cup, and she takes the glass to Miss Stirling's desk, shadowing their shoulder. “Well, you know what I
			think: the city is drab. But if you want to see the same old places on your dedicated hours off, I will tend
			to the rest of the office, I think. I've left you some water.” She saunters away, smiling from sight.
			Resting her hand on the door knob to the office. “Please, if there's anything else you need, especially this
			week, message or call. I'll go see Ms. Mica.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ashley_w">
		<p>
			Ashley takes the cup, and a long swig of the liquid. It's good. "You're good to me, Bailey. Thank you for
			all your hard work, I certainly feel much more confident in a time with less engagement with you to cover
			me. I'll try to not be too brought down by this drab little town then, as I saunter about." Miss Stirling
			politely waves off their assistant, and returns to the other room with a half-eaten cookie.
		<p>
			A rummage through the clothes storage does reveal, tucked away to the side in an almost undignified manner,
			some outfitting that while still smart and expensive is slightly too casual to wear at a company meeting.
			She'd noted a big pair of sunglasses too in her office desk, and would surely like to take those too. It's a
			fairly bright day and masking her confused stares should do well for any unexpected media presence. They
			don't know what to expect in this alternate timeline of their own home city, but with a stylish purse
			carrying all their personal odds and ends they are ready to find out.
		<p>
			Actually, she has one more cookie first, and wipes off her lips with a fine towel. Ashley simply doesn't
			think much as she leaves the building, letting habit guide her steps rather than having to follow the signs
			in her own establishment.
