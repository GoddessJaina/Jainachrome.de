	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape's vehicle parks again into the lot, coming off from the highway. And he opens the door beside him,
			with the vehicle's lights left on, and stumbles out, putting a hand on his tummy. "Anya? Anya?" He says,
			glancing into the woods. He might honk the horn if needed.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			A small display of floating, glowy orbs pull Shape's attention to a nearby tree, where Anya's perched on a
			branch and waving. He glides down and then reappears as a larger self, partially concealed behind a bush.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape smiles. "Oh, I knew you'd be here. Awesome. Well, I'm really full, I ate like two whole meals
			actually. So let's get in the car, what are we waiting for?" He walks over to take Anya's human-sized hand
			and, despite Anya's nakedness, take her into the driver's side seat with him.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			As the car is freshly driven, it's a fair bit warmer than last time inside. Taking perch on Shape's lap, she
			leans in and hums delightfully. "You're baaack~ That's a lot of food! I hope it was good for you." She
			shifts and kisses on the chin.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"It was pretty good. Ate like a large burger and fries and a large chicken salad. But anyway." He returns a
			kiss on Anya's nose, and then he squeezes Anya's waist with his hands. He'd like to touch her butt, too,
			sometime. And, for now, he finds now kissing the pink forest creature on the lips suitable. He closes his
			eyes and lets the moment hang for more than one of these kisses.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			The fairy simply chimes in a small "bubger", then reciprocates kissing and indulges in the moment. His body
			doesn't hesitate in seeking close, pressed in very eagerly against Shape. It's a loving, hungry bit of
			affection, and with each kiss and moment the fairy wants less to leave the ShapeShifter's side. "Imagine if
			you didn't get yourself terribly hexed by doing, well, whatever you were doing. We wouldn't have this."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape gasps from one of the especially hungry kisses from Anya, and he says in a sultry way, "Yeah. I don't
			even want to think about that. All that matters is we do have this... I have you." He commits to a few more
			demonstrations of physical affection, running his hand along Anya's bare bottom and even removing his own
			shirt. And then he says, "Oh, I think I might be getting ahead of myself, shouldn't I transform for you too?
			Did you come up with any ideas?" He smiles and squeezes her butt.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			The more eager touches elicit some pleased sounds from the fairy, and she leans into Shape's bare chest once
			available. "Say, for simplicity's sake since it's someone we both know recently, you should try looking like
			the gal at the gas station. It'd be a curious look on you, hehe." She moans just gently, playfully at the
			squeeze, wiggling the butt.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			He says, "Oh, I'd absolutely love to be her for you. I actually haven't tried being someone like her in a
			while, too. And I also sort of thought she was cute. So, give me a moment and maybe a little space~." He
			plays with Anya with another squeeze and short succession of kisses across her face, and then he scoots back
			on his seat, creating some distance from Anya. He closes his eyes and a cloud of beige sand starts to
			encompass the ShapeShifter, even scattering a bit on Anya, but it all magnetizes to Shape in the end.
			Shape's height is dramatically reduced in the blur to that of the woman's, and his profile becomes just as
			slim. Maybe even somewhat generically pretty, if either of them dare admit. Shape's clothes are replaced
			with tattered blue jeans and a dark shirt with a band's stencil, and instead of a belt there's some kind of
			metal chain with little loops. She has some tattoos of broken hearts and flowers at different stages of life
			and death crawling up her right arm, and she has three piercings on her ear. And her lips are completely
			black. She's a couple years younger than Shape just was biologically. The last of the magical whirlwind
			settles into Shape, and she's left blushing. "There'll be more time for me to be male later. Say hello to
			rebellious, cool Lady Shape~."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			Anya ends up hovering slightly away from Shape as this goes on, and then slowly settles back down into the
			lap. "How fascinating, you look just like her. Try not to go in there, they'll surely put you behind the
			counter for another few hours!" The fairy is a bit more blushy when she leans in for another quick kiss,
			somewhat taken by the fact that a small part of her brain feels like he's kissing a complete stranger.
			"Silly Lady Shape. You just took your shirt off. Why are you wearing a new one? Is that a bad girl thing to
			do~?" A hand presses against the now more full chest for emphasis.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			She says, "Yeah, in retrospect making out in the parking lot of a stranger's work place is just a bit
			scandalous. Oh well." Shape hums and indulges on more full kisses despite the change, and she plays more
			with Anya's butt and thigh. She giggles and says, "That was part of the package. But I don't see why I
			should keep wearing it now, good point~." She lifts her band shirt over her black hair. "Clothes are quite
			stylish though, you should try them sometime."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			"I do suppose I could, the forest just doesn't often offer references or inspiration~" The freshly revealed
			chest gets a pair of almost just curious hands on them. Testing, to see how well the shapeshifting imitates
			nature. "Do you have a sense for how people's bodies are like, or do you make an educated guess? I assume
			you've probably never seen her nakey."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, I dunno, I think there's plenty of outfits that imitate nature. Like dresses with flowers on them. But,
			well, you look great naked too, don't get me wrong." She sighs out in comfort, and she flutters her
			eyelashes. She feels out Anya for her fairy clit, and she weighs two fingers on it. "Yeah, if I have good
			enough mental image of the appearance of someone it's less guesswork and more the DNA of the person filling
			out the gaps. Like their genetic code becomes part of the change in those understood cases, at least
			probably... All I know is I'm not trying to guess what these breasts looked like. In less understood cases,
			though, I will just have to guess. Anyway." Her fingers tease the fairy.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			There's a small little squeak from Anya, and she presses her face in. She knew things were headed that way
			but Shape doesn't seem to have that much time for hesitation. The fairy's face is adorably pink as he
			presses it against shape's shoulder, and mumbles. "Please... I need it, I need you. The forest can sometimes
			be a bit of a lonely place, y'know?" Her breath is warm and heavy, and he squirms a bit.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			She stares at the fairy below her in some amount of wonder. Nobody's ever been this forward and professing
			to her; it's always the other way around. She smiles and continues to tempt the possibility of fingering
			him. She keeps Anya snug, and she nuzzles into the pink hair. "I need you too. I've been so lonely too in
			that bland, heartless city... Do you really like me? Because I love you, Anya. And I'm going to be so sad
			when I go back." She slides one digit slowly inside of Anya.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			There's a slightly radiant warmth in Shape's arms, presumably that's just natural for an aroused fairy
			though. Hopefully. "You're so good to me, my heart aches to kiss you, It's been so little time but I have
			fallen for you. And right now, my body and senses long for exactly- A-ah~! That..." The slit is very
			receptive, having grown quite waiting from just the while of closeness in the car. "I almost want you to
			simply stay but... That isn't very feasible I suppose."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Eating at the restaurant earlier, I was having a bit of fantasies about the near future, and I had just the
			idea that might let me stay with you in the forest with only the occasional need to go to the civilized—erm,
			human, world... Would that be all right, Anya, love?" She presses her finger further into the forest fairy
			and with less hesitation. "I've fallen for you too, my hero. How truly generous you are—how warm and
			honest."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			Anya's hips shuffle about needily in Shape's lap, and more warm moans escape him. "How mean of you to make
			such propositions when I'm so affected by you, but do go on..." The nuzzles shift from the shoulder and over
			to Shape's neck, and a few loving kisses find their way there. His insides are warm, damp, eager for more.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Her goth, pale face demonstrates a hue of pink with grace. She says, "I'll gather my important belongings
			and I'll camp out under your tree. I can get a very nice camping set, and like a cooler, I'll learn how to
			live like that." And, in the meantime, she joins another finger in pumping in and out of his pussy. "It'd be
			worth it for you. And I would still be able to go get groceries and like your chocolate bars sometimes."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			"It could... Ahn.... Certainly be worth a try... Please, I j-just want more of you in my life." The nuzzling
			into the neck gets more firm as Shape's fingers set a deep warmth into Anya's body. "Nh, god... You've
			certainly done this before, haven't you?" There's a slight magical tingle that passes through Shape's
			fingers. It's truly a very mystical and powerful being that the fingers are currently inside.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape can sense the magic is nothing short of the fairy's usual. She's beginning to find great comfort in
			sharing space with it. She hums, and she says with narrowing eyes, "I want more of you in mine, too, Anya. I
			really, really look forward to it. We'll have so much fun, cuddling, and sex... I have done this before, but
			never with someone as beautiful and understanding as you. I'd like to, for once, not think about the past?"
			She kisses Anya on her hair and forehead, and she streamlines her dormant hand across Anya's arching back.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			Anya nods, and whispers a very small 'sorry'. He's a tad surprised that Shape's so direct about this
			probably becoming a recurring thing when they're together, but. Well. She's not wrong. They definitely would
			fuck more. He reaches his arms around Shape's neck, and presses close eagerly. Chest to chest, fairy to
			shapeshifter. A fast, excited and aroused breath interspersed with increasingly heavy moans. Shape's fingers
			and parts of the hand are now generously slick.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape encourages a moan out of her own lips in response to Anya's moans and their contacting chests. She
			nuzzles the fairy's small arms with her cheek and chin, and she paces along the fingering fast and steady.
			She puts her free hand over her pink lips. "Let's savor this, Hero. I love you; I feel so alive." Anya, even
			if elevated beyond human sexual limitations, crawls to a chaotic climax. The glow is visible from outside
			the car.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			With a mostly lust-filled mind, Anya nuzzles into the hand and then takes her lips around one of the
			fingers, nibbling and licking it. She gasps past it, and his hips are swaying into the motion of the fingers
			now. "God... I'm going to... Soon... Please, no one has made me feel like this in a while, Thank you..." It
			truly isn't much left, delicate little noises in between the heavier sighs and moans. The magical
			stimulation is a vaguely perceivable buzz at this point - It's surprising how potent one small being of the
			woods can be.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			She stares into his eyes and giggles at his play with her fingers in front of their faces. And she pushes
			deeper sometimes inside the fairy, past Anya's comfortable region. It's never too far or too long—merely
			casual limit-testing that Shape gauges with fairy noises and expressions. Anya's stimulation and thoughts
			crawl all across her body as if they are lively little ants, and she finally falls over her tall edge—she
			orgasms, writhing and writhing, her potent aura coming off in tangible, energized bursts that only serve to
			liven Shape and the scene.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			The depth of the fairy seem more receptive than one would expect, not showing much resistance as Shape
			pushes deeper. Anya progresses through a range of sounds before finally a long, whiny plea accompanies her
			exit, body trembling against her newfound lover, fairy glow glistening on and around them, thighs clamping
			against Shape's lap as the peak of bodily tension is passed over. And soon enough, the fairy sinks together,
			breaths slightly longer with each pass.
		<p>
			"Oh, god..."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			She leaves her fingers inside of Anya for even some minutes before receding them. Shape's tattered jeans
			smell of sex. She licks her finger, blinks, and then rubs off the rest of the fairy cum on her fingers
			against Anya's cheek. "You are so, so sexy and precious. I've never had someone make such adorable noises
			for me. I hope I've satisfied you sexually for now, fairy. If I remember anything about fairies it's that
			they can spring back quickly from this kind of thing, right?" She presses her face against Anya's.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			"Do people say that about fairies, mmm? What very specific and odd things to have rumors about. But maybe
			there's some truth to it~. You'll find out soon enough." Anya nuzzles, ignoring that she's spreading the
			slickness on her cheek all over both of them. That's Shape's own fault. "For now, indeed, but who knows how
			long it'll suffice." Kiss.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"...Oh, yeah, to be clear I'm not saying fairies or you are like supposed to be whores or anything like
			that. In fact, yeah, I'm not sure why those rumors exist. Maybe I just need to stop hanging around the mean
			crowd for information like this, huh? Like I said earlier, you've been defying every expectation." Shape has
			little regard for the cum, and she kiss her lips again and again. She says, "Come on, babe, let's lower the
			seat."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			"That's the joy of being a mystical being, people come in with the wildest preconceptions and I can play
			around with those if I feel like it." He pushes against Shape's chest, enjoying the thought of more lying
			down on top of her. Kisses get returned as eagerly. "Don't be gone too long when you arrange your supplies,
			okay? I'll miss you."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Ah, see, that's one thing that was always true of fairies, though: you all definitely know how to be
			tricky. I could perhaps learn a thing or two from it. Seems fun." She pulls the lever beside the seat and
			the two of them recline backwards. Shape wraps both arms around Anya's lower back, and she closes her eyes.
			"I'll miss you too... I'll take only a couple days. I promise. I shouldn't have any much loose ends."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			The fairy yawns, and settles on top of the ShapeShifter. "Remember to bring snacks. And give some thought to
			anything you could try to amuse Yarrow with. Don't want to make her feel like the rare genuine charity went
			to waste." He nuzzles and kisses into anywhere she can reach.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Snacks it is... And honestly I'm a bit scared of Yarrow now that it's in the past, are you sure that I have
			to do that? She seems like she would genuinely hurt me if I upset her... In any case, what kind of stuff
			does she like? The human world has all kinds of stuff I could find her." She yawns. She's not used to laying
			down with this many piercings.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, she's not outright scary or evil, but it'd be good to reward her for well. Taking part in saving you.
			It doesn't have to be anything excessive but something that makes her feel special of sorts? And do remember
			that she lives in a swamp. She could store it in a tree or something if it's not outright immune to being
			submerged but it needs to last some time through humid outside climates."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Right..." Shape sighs. "She did save my life too by extension of allowing us to get the necrolily. All
			right then, I guess I'll find something that makes her feel special, maybe a couple things. While I'm at it,
			I think I'll find something thematically appropriate as well for Ophelia. And I'll see what I have that you
			might like besides snacks."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			The fairy mostly falls quiet, settling in. Coming down has probably made him sleepy.
	</div>
