	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape walks into the deciduous forest wrapped in a brown wool coat with a hoodie. Twigs crack and dry soil
			shifts under his feet, and the afternoon sun is lost from the thin tree canopy. He rubs his mittens together
			and then trots on, his freezing heart beating faster. He or she should be close enough now to see him and
			help him remove this gray hex imbued by that backstabber. She had to help him—fairies in general didn't just
			let people die, did they? Not from something so slow to be lethal at least. They're usually tricky and
			impatient about these things, from what he's seen, and not often murderers anyway. Shape shivers, buckling
			onto a thick layer of vibrant grass. He calls out, "Anya? I heard about y-you." He then covers his lips with
			his coat.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			There is no response at first, but soon after in the shaded lighting appears a gently glowing speck of light
			some distance away. It drifts in wave motions, slowly approaching the poor little fellow and finally
			lingering just a few feet away. It sits there, quietly. Waiting.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			His lips are shown again, and he exhales an icy mist. "Thank G-Gods for being here. Anya I've been... Cursed
			to be really cold. I can show you the hex marking— it's on my wrist." He rolls down the sleeve of the coat
			partway and turns his wrist to the speck of light. The gray marking resembles a lattice of six icicles, and
			the color sinks deep into the skin and nerves. "Please, Anya, fair—fairy of these woods." He knows this
			can't be enough, but he should be able to convince her.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			The little glowing orb drifts away barely halfway through the riveting elaboration as if it had no interest
			at all, floating upwards towards a nearby tree. Past it, from Shape's view, is a suspiciously dense cluster
			of branches. Not something one would take note of if not deliberately looking up - and as the glow passes
			through a clear, rectangular opening, it's clear there's a small house in the crown of the tree. The gentle
			glow illuminates an open doorframe and a small window beside it.
		<p>
			A small voice pipes up, sounding somewhat unawake and disgruntled.
			"Who's you? What do you want? I was in the middle of a nap so this better be important."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape bites his lip and looks behind him, as if hoping someone else would pipe in. "Well I just explained
			during it but to recap—" He faces the little opening of the house. "Anya, fair fairy of the woods, I've been
			hexed by a bad sorceress. I grow colder and colder, like in the literal sense, as in I'm freezing slowly
			inside and I really need your help. I learned of you before and—well, I'd be eternally grateful for your
			assistance." He huddles into a fetal position.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			Out from the slight overhang outside the house peeks a small face with pink hair falling down around it.
			Anya tilts her head aside, observing. "I was going to say that I've heard way better stories for the purpose
			of getting it on with a fairy, but that actually looks bad. You didn't answer the 'who's you' part, though.
			I can't legally bind you to my totally not suspicious magical trickeries if I don't know that." She giggles.
			"Also it's just polite."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape nods and rubs his knees together. "Right. Okay. Please just call me Shape... That is my name. I have
			magical tricks of my own, but they're not helpful here unfortunately." He lifts his chin. "This isn't my
			first rodeo with a fairy, so... Is it all right if we keep the tricks until after—this? I feel terrible,
			Anya."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			"Ooookiedokie! I'll be right down!" Anya stands up to the edge; he's now visible with a very light coverage
			of what seems like woven plant garments. A quick and elegant flip off the edge, she dives down towards the
			ground. Letting her wings catch the fall at the very end, he swoops forward and rolls into the grass next to
			Shape before fluttering back up above to get a good look.
		<p>
			"So, Shape. What can you tell or show me? I need to know what I'm working with here and I'm not like those
			'licensed doctors' who stick fancy gadgets in your face holes." He flutters about anyhow, looking for
			whatever she can.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Anya is, to Shape, practically a fairy tale fairy. Living in what's essentially a bird house, covered in
			leaf, agile and beyond gender, Anya could easily be in a Disney Renaissance film. But appearances are only
			appearances. He smiles, through the cold teeth, and uncovers his wrist for him again. "I can't even remember
			the last time I did traditional medicine... Wait, never mind, I had a Tylenol a couple weeks ago. But yeah,
			this marking must have did something to my sensory system..." He doesn't bother to follow Anya's erratic
			flight.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			She doesn't hesitate to start inspecting the markings, waving her hands a few times to make magic sparkles
			and seeming more and more displeased with each cast. "You, uh... You got yourself into some real shit,
			didn't you? This is not your average corner store hex." He focuses and manifests a glow over the markings,
			but it is too rejected and only serves to cause a brief but terrible itch in the markings. "I'll need some
			time and also stuff to actually dispel this, but I should be able to mitigate some of it temporarily to
			start. You're going to owe me for this."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah, I guess I did. It wasn't supposed to be like this, but somebody didn't want to play by the
			established..." He shivers. "It's okay, I'm really grateful you're here. Thank you again—I'll definitely
			make it up to you, yeah, definitely since it's so serious and all." Assuming, of course, the bargain was
			even reasonable, and the fairy continued to play nice. He scratches the temporary itch on the marking, but
			his mittens make it ineffective. "If there's anything I can do in the meantime to help, I'll try. Mm—" Shape
			winces and clutches over his heart.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			Anya moves aside a bit, and there's a sudden bright flash of pink that envelops her location. As it fades
			again seconds later, there's now a small but distinctly human sized Anya in his place, sitting in the grass.
			He puts a hand to his chest, and carefully conjures out a radiant orb of light. Holding it out, the
			slightest semblance of warmth washes over the skin that's closest to the manifestation.
		<p>
			"I'll let you borrow some of my warmth, for now. It should probably make you a little bit less miserable,
			though stoking it somehow would surely make it much stronger." The orb sinks into Shape's chest, and it does
			indeed do a job of mitigating the deep-seated frost inside.
		<p>
			Worth noting that in the shapeshift, the grassy attire has not persisted and Anya's only decency currently
			is waist length pink hair falling over his somewhat flat chest, and the tall grass coming high enough up the
			body to conceal her crossed legs.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			A tear sheds from Shape's eye before the orb enters into his chest. It's a remarkable sensation—Shape feels
			at about eighty percent, instead of ten. But, of course, it's tapered with concerns. He takes off his
			mittens and unbuttons his winter coat, revealing his casual red t-shirt. He even has some sweat glisten on
			his forehead from the sudden warmth of the winter coat before placing it aside. He runs his hand across his
			face and says, "Thank you, Anya. I feel guilty about borrowing your warmth as you say. I'd rather you stay
			warm too. But... This is really helpful, for now. Can I help in some way with the process of the cure?" He
			stares at the human-size Anya, glazing at his eyes and his vibrant hair down to her waist. "You do look
			pretty, I will mention. Is your hair always that color?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			She does not hesitate to drape Shape's coat loosely over her shoulders, giving off a slight shiver as he's
			now not entirely oblivious to somewhat mild air. "Aw, thank you. And yes, it's my favorite color. I've tried
			a lot of variations but I do always come back to this." The warmth in Shape's chest picks up, remarkably in
			pace with the ever so slight appreciative blush on Anya's face. It fades again, though, as soon as it came.
			This must be what he meant by 'stoking the warmth'.
		<p>
			"You're quite precious too, you are. And I'm not just saying that because you're such a pitiful state right
			now. As for the hex... We'll need some concentrated soulfire, strong enough to melt the core of bitter cold
			seated inside you in one go. There's a good few steps to that. You said you have some assortment of magic
			yourself, what kinds? There's a good chance any of them might prove useful."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			Shape smiles, weakly, and touches the coat draping Anya now. The sudden warmth that flares up in the orb
			inside Shape is a nice coincidence to the fairy's moment... In any case, Shape just wants to stay close to
			Anya, and assist him closely. He tilts his head, and says, "I'm precious? That's very nice of you to say,
			really flattering. Yeah... I think I'm a bit better usually, too. But yeah, 'concentrated soulfire,' sounds
			a bit elusive and maybe painful, but we'll do whatever it takes. My abilities... Are a bit of a one-trick
			pony, and probably not very helpful here. I'd show you, but I think I'd pass out, maybe. I'm a shapeshifter,
			and I usually prefer to keep it in the realm of human vessels. What you see here is a common one of mine.
			I'm not sure many dedicated shapeshifters exist in this region; I've struggled to find more like me anyway.
			Usually it's just one thing of many in the toolkit of a greater magical presence."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			"It's actually not very painful at all. If you use it correctly, of course. It's like..." She pokes at the
			place the orb had entered his chest. "Like that, but more. Again! If you don't fuck it up and give your
			emotions third degree burns. It's really uncomfortable if you do that. You'd start having grating, itching
			sensations inside whenever you experience Feelings for the next while. So let's avoid that." He shuffles
			around a bit, to try and promote some more warmth. Couldn't this have happened in some manner of toasty
			summer day? Oh well, the fairy thinks.
		<p>
			"Shapeshifting, huh? I... Don't think that's exactly what we need for this project unless there's a magical
			reagents store nearby you could impersonate the staff of. I need to revisit the exact details of some proper
			soulfire distillation, but I think we're in luck and we could find most of the ingredients in the general
			vicinity. I might have to recruit some friends for the purpose. You don't have any stockpiled magical
			thingymabobs to exploit, by chance?" She resists making a comment on being one of those people where
			shapeshifting is just a part of his assortment of magical fairy skills.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, what a relief. Well, I much prefer having those emotional burns compared to having died, so it's
			definitely something I'm happy to risk." Shape furrows his eyes as Anya keeps adjusting in the coat, and he
			puts his hand under the coat when there's an opening, rubbing her shoulder in an apologetic gesture. "I was
			thinking, maybe if you're really cold now we could also grab some more blankets during this process? Do I
			feel warmer to you now too, maybe that'd help?" He sits pretty much at Anya's side, towering a bit over him,
			and then he says, "If that store exists, I honestly might be all right with just buying it unless it's
			really expensive. Recruiting your friends sounds good, though, yeah. I think we'll probably need help. All
			my stockpiled magical things are not here, they're back home, which is like several miles out, we'd have to
			get my car which is like.. Kinda far from here too. Mild potions and my runestones probably aren't what you
			need, though?" He considers if he's even in a state to drive, or get to the car.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			Anya sighs softly and leans into the touch, seeming very little objecting to having her bare skin touched by
			a complete stranger like this. The hand is a tad chilly but it's the gesture is warmer than the magic is
			cold. He leans in slightly, and seems... Again, slightly more warm to Shape's chest. "Well, it is quite
			unfortunate that you decided to show up in the afternoon. Considering, well. I have a small fairy home for
			small fairies, and while I could offer a blanket or two, they're kind of." He makes a gesture with his hands
			that indicates a square too small to cover a person. "Did you plan to like. Just get poofed back into
			okayness? That seems a bit well optimistic an outcome, to me."
		<p>
			It is, in fact, slowly getting a bit shadier and it's a question of time before the cool night will start
			settling in. Considering the two are already clawing at a limited reserve, that's less than ideal. It seems
			just a bit more sizeable though, as the fairy cuddles gently into their side.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Shape_w">
		<p>
			As Shape's chest warms again in a disjoint way once more, he takes his free hand to feel it through his
			shirt. And, with his other hand, he touches and teases her neck and upper back as well, feeling the orb's
			radiant heat adapt in real time. He gets close enough with the fairy that he's partially inside the coat as
			well, granted only part of his side. "Yeah... I didn't really want to come here in the afternoon, or
			actually at all, I merely had to because I was dying and I knew that a fairy of these woods could help. You
			are very generous though, and again, pretty." He smirks and looks away for a moment. "I have to be
			optimistic. Well... If the house is too small, and it's becoming dark, I think we should go to my car. I
			promise it'll be comfortable for a woodland presence like you. There's like a scented tree in it. Heating as
			well. Then we can figure out what to do." The sky's color, too, is colder, and receding into an early
			sunset.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			All the caressing and the gentle compliments make the effect unmistakable for both parts. But the fairy
			doesn't comment on it or give of any sign that he's noticed. She does, however, nuzzle more into him. "I
			see... Apologies, I tend to be visited by the most leisurely of passerbys that think talking to a fairy
			about some manner of hex or ailment is like taking a vacation. It's serious business... I guess your state
			is quite dire though, so good on you for reacting quickly. If you have heating in your car then that is
			probably a better option than most things. I think Lydia's busy today so she couldn't even take you in,
			probably. And that'd be one of the better remaining options. So. We must go, to your car."
		<p>
			The fairy is still quite bare, but she uproots a handful of grass and, holding it in her hand, transforms
			back into small. Curiously, his magic can settle the grass back into the cute plant coverings he had
			earlier, but... He only hovers just briefly before the both notice the biting cold set in now that the much
			less voluminous fairy is producing considerably less heat. Swiftly, she poofs back, landing face first into
			the grass.
		<p>
			"Well, fuck. That's not great."
