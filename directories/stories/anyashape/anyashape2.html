    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape winces as she plants into the grass, and he helps her off the ground with both arms, keeping the coat
        tucked around her. He wipes off the grass and dirt from her face with his hands and a bit of his shirt, and he
        admits, "This would be a bit easier if I had warm water. I think maybe we could... Find some warm water for us
        too?" He wraps his arm around the fairy's back and walks him with him, at this point feeling the larger
        responsibility in getting them now both to a safe place. Sure, the fairy wouldn't die, but it would be very
        unpleasant otherwise to walk alone. And, yes, he recognizes that he literally feels warmer when she feels
        warmer, in an exaggerated symbiosis of things. Even if the warmth is, in some ways, a flavor of something Shape
        has experienced many times himself and herself in their life, and at this point they wonder would ever persist
        more than a few evenings in a row. Several minutes pass, and shadows stretch far in front of them. "Have you
        lived here your whole life, Anya, or are fairies like you pretty nomadic?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        "It's fine, don't worry about it. I do get a bit grimy from time to time. Such is being a mostly nakey fairy in
        the woods!" He's not wrong, too, now that she's no longer sitting in the grass it's instead the oversized jacket
        keeping him not too indecent. Warm water... There are springs and rivers but best of luck finding any with good
        temperature to it at this time of day. She dismisses the thought to herself, unless Shape somehow offers a
        better idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I have been here for a very long time, though I didn't settle here originally. I had some places earlier but
        none of them were quite as wonderful and homely as the grove. There's good people and life in these woods, this
        area. Much of magical potency to make use of for my abilities. The easier access I have to these things, the
        less people I have to disappoint and the more people I can cheat for their firstborn!" She giggles, but then
        adds. "Sorry, just a joke. There's so many rumors of fairies being the greediest bastards and having
        unreasonable demands, I've talked to people prepared to part with the most unnecessary things before. What am I
        meant to do with a baby? Weird lil' skin objects, they are."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Must be nice to be naked whenever you want, though. Sometimes I just want to be naked, but I also have to go
        out in public often, so what can I really do you know?" He pauses thoughtfully, continuing to lead the both of
        them to the car with a kind intimacy. There's off in the distance some artificial light they can make out
        briefly pass by, and another dimmer, more persistent one. "The grove, eh? If they're friends with you, they're
        friends with me... Unless you're serious about the firstborn thing." He returns a laugh too, and bites his lip.
        "Yeah, no worries. I heard all of those rumors. I also actually met fairies who were like that, but I mean so
        far I don't have much reason to doubt you, and the moment you do something kinda weird I think I'll be all right
        now. Actually, it maybe would be funny, when all things were well, that you show me a bit more about the sort of
        funny full 'magical potency' things you'd be capable of. I am awfully curious." He pushes a finger on her tummy,
        before resuming a regular hold. The dim light in the distance is clearly part of the gas station Shape parked
        at, and the grove behind them is darker, denser, and more lifeless from the outside, especially at this time of
        falling night, than from the inside.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        "Well, my strategy of being a mythical woodland creature that is above regular human standards has worked well
        for me but it's not something others can just adapt for themselves, I suppose. The people here aren't too
        excited to your average outsider but if you're nice enough I can put in a good word for you~" She wiggles
        slightly at the poke of the tummy, seeming just a little startled but flattered by his curiosity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anya stops a bit, as she surveys the increasingly visible outside of the area. She doesn't venture out too often
        any more, and as time passes things always end up... different. There's a timeless peace to the grove in
        comparison, as if it intentionally rejects those who seek to make it adapt to modernity, rather than adapt
        themselves. Oh, and she almost completely forgot. Can't leave home without a note! In her hands she conjures a
        light orb similar to the one that originally greeted Shape, but this time a pulsating orange instead. He lets it
        go and it drifts away the direction they came from.
      </p>

      <p>"Okay. Gas station. Cars. Cool human technology. Let's go."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Yeah, even with my ability it's not like I can pretend to be a woodland druid for long before I'm expected to,
        I dunno, grow flowers from a rock or something. I'd appreciate a good word though, aw." He smiles, watching the
        fairy's expression whenever he's not making sure the ground immediately in front of them doesn't dip into a
        crevice. The light orb is curious, and Shape watches it as well. And then he, finally, walks up a small hill
        into the parking lot of the gas station with Anya and digs in his pocket for his keys, which are thankfully
        clipped on. He unlocks the doors and they climb inside, and he turns on the vehicle to a low setting for heater
        while keeping the engine shut off. He lowers the music immediately, and slouches in the driver's seat. "I never
        thought I'd be so happy to hear country music again. You saved my life." He reaches for the scented air
        freshener dangling from the mirror, and he hands it to Anya. It says "Pine-scented." He shrugs, and breathes
        slowly with the warmth of the car and the piece of Anya inside him.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya, having very little awareness of the general usage of a car up close, takes a few curious laps around the
        odd can of metal before finally, with some effort, managing to take up seat on the other side of the car and
        closing the door after himself. For the warmth. She accepts the funny little caricature tree and gives it a
        curious sniff. It sure smells like the vague idea of a tree. "So, Shape, why do humans decide to put real tree
        inside a fake tree? Isn't that what real trees are for? I'd generally prefer a pine over pine imitation
        cardboard." She does feel a bit more comfortable in the slowly heating car, but still wiggling a bit since she's
        just not... used to being cold.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        He taps his fingers on the steering wheel. He checks the phone he, in a frenzy, left in the car much prior.
        Nobody, not even from the person that inflicted the hex or something. He says, "I have never really thought of
        that before, but I guess it's because bugs exist, so like maybe there would be termites or ants trapped in the
        car if I tried to grow a small pine tree in the car instead. Also there might be space issues." He reaches a
        hand back to Anya again, and sighs. "Yeah. Sorry, I know this isn't the most comfortable thing you've sat in. So
        I guess we're just going to be here all night, or maybe we should drive somewhere together if you prefer. I
        worry about taking us too far from your forest, though." He looks in the side mirror, and continues, "I guess
        the gas station is also open? They'll have running warm water. And snacks. And a sad college student."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        "I tend to have the experience that the gas station kicks me out for being nakey if I don't impress them with my
        magics, but I suppose I can pass off as dressed with just the jacket with some hope." She ponders a bit, then
        smiles happily at Shape. "I want one of those tasty chocolate things. Snickles, I think they are. Something like
        that. You'll get me one of those, if you can. Since you owe me."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape blinks a lot. "What? Why were you... That's just pretty silly, I guess, but must have been for a chocolate
        bar, I guess, yeah. I'll grab you one here. Come." He climbs out of the vehicle with Anya, closing his door for
        him and wrapping up the jacket a bit lower on their figure. It's low enough to work, and when they enter the
        small building its evident the cashier is really not going to put a fuzz. She is young, true to Shape's
        prediction, with dark lipstick and eyes only supported from Monster. Shape nods at her and leads Anya to the
        bathrooms, where he hesitates to place Anya in either bathroom briefly before choosing the men's room. Shape is
        presenting male, after all. "If you turn the faucet there you'll get a running stream of cold water with a bit
        of fluoride, the other faucet can warm it up."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        The fairy eyes the wares quite curiously, now that she actually has the chance to do so mostly unhindered. He
        doesn't give any mind to the bathroom signs, not aware of this whole hassle of society in any way. He gives his
        attention to the curious knobs, and slowly manages to figure out how they're supposed to be operated. With some
        efforts and one displeased beep at some too warm water at some point, it settles at a moderate stream of good
        temperature. "Weird object. But I like it."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Nice. I'll be right back, I think I'll grab you your chocolate bar." He winks and leaves the bathroom. He makes
        quick work of finding the chocolate bars, but he spends an awkward amount of time figuring out which one is the
        regular one. No thanks to cookies and cream or peanut butter or dark. He takes the regular chocolate bar to the
        cashier, and during the purchase exchange of cash, Shape says, "You know, I was a little worried about that
        person in the bathroom earlier, but I'm starting to think they're kind of hot. They sort of saved my life and
        have a killer figure. I'm thinking I should get closer to them?" The cashier is apathetic, and says, "Sure,
        yeah."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya spends some time fascinated by the mirror. She's more used to ponds and smooth reflective crystals and
        shards of polished metal or such. Seeing his face so clearly is almost eerie. But also very flattering! He does
        get started wiping off as much dirt and the likes he can, but. Also take a whole lot of time observing their own
        reflection. An untreated vanity being sated. Some very minor details being shapeshifted into place, nothing
        really noticeable but if she's already at a mirror, she might as well take the chance. Soon enough, he's clean
        and fresh and decides to just run his slightly cool hands under a reasonably toasty stream of water, to soak in
        the warmth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape walks into the bathroom once more, and Anya's reflection in the mirror seems somehow more pristine than
        when he left. He chalks this up subconsciously to his increasing appreciation and sexual desire for the pink
        woodland creature. The chocolate plops beside the sink, and then his arms wrap around her mid-back. Shape
        squeezes lightly, and he leans more into and over her. The warmth of the orb increases once more, and Shape
        ducks his eyes from the reflection and smiles. "Did the water and I warm you? I got your chocolate bar, a small
        token of my appreciation for the fairy who helps me."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya smiles warmly at Shape's reflection, and she nods appreciatively at the choice of chocolate. It's the one!
        She recognizes the color.
      </p>

      <p>
        As his figure gets enveloped in warm and caring arms, she lets her body lean back into Shape. The warmth is
        clear and mutual, and she hums delightedly. "Thank you for the treat! You did warm me, yes. I think... I think
        we both know what this added warmth is. And it'll make the time until we get you fixed much more comfortable."
        She rubs the back of her head into Shape's chest.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape has never quite curbed the almighty unwanted erection. He ends up awkwardly pulling back his lower body
        during their moment of cuddly affection. And the enthusiasm in her voice and in her trust physically with Shape
        leaves him enchanted. It's not magic—it's just trust.
      </p>

      <p>
        He says to him, "I think I know what the warmth is too; it's your delight for your chocolate bar. Just kidding."
        Shape laughs, and Anya can feel his chest shift. "Speaking of making our time until then more comfortable, I
        think we should head back to the car. I'm worried I'll get sick if I stand in here too long." He gestures at the
        toilet with the wad of toilet paper. "We could just hang out back there."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya nods. Car is warm and toasty. Just like shape is being right now, if you discount the biting cold that
        refuses to back down too much. "Yeah. We should. Some quiet and warmth and comfy is good for the soul." She
        picks up the chocolate bar and stuffs it into a jacket pocket.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "You have such a particular vocabulary. It's like warm itself, if that makes sense." He walks with him out of
        the bathroom, and separates them from the hug midway. He holds Anya's hand, though, and keeps his side brushed
        to him. "But yeah, that was a good success. You got some warm water and chocolate." Shape smiles at the cashier,
        once more, and Anya and him settle in the car again with the ignition turned on and heater running, although
        this time Shape keeps the gap between their seats bridged with the hand holding.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        "I don't really care much if things make sense in the way most people would. It comes with being a fairy, you
        live to break with expectations. hehe." Anya cozies into his seat, warming his rear after having it mostly bare
        and out in the cold for a bit. She produces the chocolate bar, unwraps it a bit in the end, and takes a
        surprisingly small nibble out of it before setting it aside on the dashboard. "Tasty. Just like I remembered."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape nods, and stares at the tiny bite. "You have defied many expectations today, I have to admit. I was
        pessimistic going into this, mostly, so that was... where I was." He slides some of his fingers between Anya's
        own fingers, locking up their held hands. "Tell me a bit about the last time you were out here buying chocolate.
        How did you get legal tender? I have a bit of a sweet tooth as well. Sometimes I can indulge it, like I used to
        love these milkshakes they'd sell in some diners..."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        "Well I'm glad you turned around on that, I do like making it worth the time for people to bother me because
        honestly that doesn't happen quite as often! Seeing as the forest only really likes to accommodate people who
        have the spirit for it."
      </p>

      <p>
        He licks his lips, seeming to savor every bit of the chocolate nibble before even considering going back for
        more. "Nono. It wasn't like that. I was bored and people watching from one of the treetops when I spotted
        someone drop a weird object as they left. People rarely ever come back here soon once they go away so swooped in
        and took it! It was one of these. Fully clothed and all." She points at the chocolate bar, specifically the side
        that's still wrapped. "If it was something that seemed more special or important I'd have left it, don't worry."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "I'm glad too, Anya, dear," Shape says, with a polite inflection. "You'd think a ShapeShifter like me would have
        become pretty attuned to forests, live as a bear or something for a while, but I have always been rather
        indoors, and I just always found being human the best choice for me." The flicker of memory about the house a
        child Shape briefly formed family bonds to comes to mind. He sighs, and rubs his chest. "Yeah, I suspect that
        the person didn't miss it. I'm glad you got to try one of these. You'll be delighted to know the human world is
        full of sugary delights, artificial and more, well, natural-aligned. Like, yeah, those milkshakes." He stares
        into the pink eyes, and he says, "Oh well, no more human treats for you for a while, I suppose..."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        "Maybe it's just in your nature! I hope this isn't rude or uncomfortable to ask. Are you. Are you a
        human-shapeshifter or a shapeshifter-shapeshifter? If you get what I mean." He carefully shifts some pink hair
        off his forehead. "I'm a fairy, after all, so it's natural I end up doing fairy things despite being able to
        shift into whatever, really."
      </p>

      <p>
        Her eyes latch on in return, and she seems temporarily captivated by this exchange of gaze. She's slightly
        flushed, slightly warmer. Despite a few blinks, he maintains for however long Shape intends to. "I suppose...
        Unless I magically, contractually bind you into being my supplier foreeever~"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "I'm a human-shapeshifter. Like, yeah, I was born a human. Much like you came to as a fairy, maybe, yeah." He
        leans more on the divider between the two seats, maintaining the gaze with more smiling. "I suppose it's normal
        to have your tendencies, then. Like how you would trick me to give you chocolate every so often, sure. How would
        I fall for something like that, pink creature? I'm very curious how such a deception works, if you'd so kindly
        give me an example." Shape blinks slowly, and he lowers his chair back. He still maintains holding Anya's hand.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya leans in as well, smiling and giggling softly. Especially leant forward instead of sitting upright he seems
        so very petite of a figure next to Shape. "I don't think you'd need to fall for it, I'd simply state it as a
        binding clause for when I am to finally dispel your ailment. No monthly candy, and you'll pay the price for
        defying a fairy's demands~"
      </p>

      <p>
        Her eyes fall down Shape's face a bit, and... There's another spark of warmth in them both. She turns her face
        away, blushing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Yeah, you're absolutely right. It's only fair, my most generous and pretty fairy Anya, that I return you the
        favor with monthly payments of candy." Shape, though, suspects he'd visit more than that. He tugs on Anya's arm
        lightly, and he stays put in his laying position on the lowered head rest. Her giggle and smile are images that
        stick in his mind, even when his eyes are closed. And, catching her admiring his face in return, Shape teases
        him. "I think there's another way you can fall for something, or someone. Is your chair comfortable, hmm?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya responds by taking the chocolate bar and securing herself another small gnaw on it, about the same as the
        last time. "Do make sure to add some good variation to the mix, then. I think only having... Snickers all the
        time will ruin a bit of the magic~ And yes, I'm quite comfortable. Passably. Not like I have many other places
        to sit in this car, hehe." Her glance passes over most of Shape as she says so. "Falling for people is
        surprisingly easy to do, yes. And it doesn't have to involve trickery and deceit."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "We'd never run out of different chocolate bars for you to try, let alone other treats, or sodas, or maybe even
        desserts." Shape says. He then yawns, and tugs on Anya once more. "Passable... Yeah, that won't do, I'll remind
        you you saved my life. I bet you're still just a bit cold, and could use a little extra warmth. Is that right?"
        Honestly, the car is quite warm enough. The fairy isn't going to really need it. At least, not because he is
        physically chilly. Shape mumbles, "Yeah, trickery is just for making things happen one of the people doesn't
        want, I think... That's what trickery is."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        "Some extra warmth, you say? I would love that, certainly. What can you offer me, hmm?" She could very much
        manage as is, but whatever Shape may have in mind sounds very much delightful. He once again licks his lips to
        find any stray chocolate spots that may have eluded him. "Trickery is so many things, really, sometimes it's
        actually for the better too. But if you can achieve everything you desire without, then... There's no real
        reason to."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape leans forward from his cozy position in his reclined seat, and he drapes his arms around Anya's shoulders,
        and he then clasps his back with this. Now, once more, the human shapeshifter tugs on the fairy. He keeps his
        sleepy eyes open, and he says, "I offer you my arms, and my chest. I'd be honored if you'd lay with me, my—sexy
        savior." He tries not to giggle, thinking the compliment to be awkward. Anya's lick is another one of those
        pleasant images that doesn't leave the mind. "Yeah," he adds.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya does not object or resist one bit, and with a single fluid motion he's made the way across the car and is
        sat in Shape's lap as best as the space of the car allows. "I accept, Shape. I've heard the phrase 'sexy' thrown
        about a few times my way but it feels... Different when you say it now, hehe. It's warmer. And I mean, I do try
        after all, I want to get my money's worth out of being a shapeshifter." His head rests against the chest, and
        they both are indeed warmer now. For various reasons.

        Shape, in the burst of excitement brought forth from the acceptance, rubs Anya's back and rustles his hair over
        and over, and Shape lays back down on his head rest at a low angle once more. Anya's brought down with him,
        pressed to his low incline chest. He says, "Thank you so much, you amazing fairy Anya, you're so cute and
        wonderful and fun so far I can't help but to have asked." He continues, "I'm glad I have a warmness to when I
        say 'sexy.' As a fellow ShapeShifter, I suppose I know all too well that you don't want to be seen as an object
        of beauty, you know, so the sexiness I'm describing is more than appearances, you know? You're sexy on the
        inside. You saved my life, and make me smile, and now I even want to hold you close." As he squeezes the fairy
        against his chest, it's abundant how bright the orb gets.

        Anya can't help but be amused over how gushy the poor other has become in her proximity. "You're impressively
        adorable. I do mean that I put effort into a being a sexy and beautiful creature since I'm able to do so! And if
        people think I'm sexy that's just confirmation of my talents! But. I can't shapeshift myself into an internally
        sexy person as easily so. It's a different kind of flattering to hear that. You're quite like that too,
        honestly? It's been a very cozy and warm time despite today being the coldest I've felt in so long."

        She makes herself more comfortable in his lap. She's... still bare under the jacket and with how leant back
        Shape is she's properly settled in close to him. She knows. And she's very warm too.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape nuzzles Anya, and his eyes start to close once more. He keeps the fairy and jacket over his chest when
        seeking the warmth of both for the night. He says to him with a more leveled air, "You are, in fact, quite
        talented. I've never seen someone do that thing with the orb, and have it be comfortable even." The orb has been
        quite warm. "I'm very flattered you'd think of me as so sexy on the inside as well. I really try to be the best
        person I can be, but sometimes I'm not sure if I have." And sometimes he's on a more selfish streak. But this
        was a mutual feeling. This orb was, always, warm. "I'm glad to keep you warm... That was a long day."

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya slowly settles in as well, starting to become quite snoozy. It's surprisingly comfortable, all in all, and
        while the warmth is still strong it seems a good time to fall asleep and hope it carries on through the night.
        "I hope you accounted for me sleeping here. It will happen now."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape nods. "Wasn't letting you sleep cold," He says. Shape is able to drift into a comfortable state of sleep.
        Anya manages to not only aid in that, like so much else today, but transcend everything Shape disliked about
        fairies. Maybe he just didn't give them a fair chance until now. More likely, Anya was a bit different.
