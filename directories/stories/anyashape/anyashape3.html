    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        The night passes uneventfully, and Anya sleeps through quite comfortably even if the cold has slowly set in
        again with the strong gay vibes having eased off a bit in the sleep. The sun cuts into the inside of the car as
        it rises over the east, separating the forest on its one side and more open land on the other. This is quite
        unusual for a fairy that lives in the woods, and he stirs, beeping softly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape mumbles and stretches his arms behind him, recognizing the events of yesterday. The pink hair of the fairy
        shimmers in the low sun. He rubs Anya's scalp. "Hey, you're up. I'm up now too." He licks his lips, which are
        chapped. "That was really special. But I guess it's time for the ingredients. When I'm ready."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        The fairy makes some various grumbly noises as he stretches, not quite used to being awakened like this. But
        Shape's here and that's cozy.
      </p>

      <p>
        "So, yes. There's a few things we'll need. Nala owes me some favors so I can easily send message and expect to
        have her deliver some flarebloom at my house sometime during the day. I know where to get some nice catalytic
        crystals too. We won't need too much, soulfire is pretty densely packed." She makes a few more mental thinkings.
        "And I think we'll have to see if Yarrow's in a good mood. Probably is though. I heard Lydia's been occupying
        her. She has... Things. In her Domain. That we need. Anyhow."
      </p>

      <p>
        The fairy sizes up Shape again. He's a bit scrawny and such, after all, which isn't ideal for a grove round
        trip, but it should be fine. "I hope you don't mind a bit of rocky terrain."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape nods a few times, accepting that the fairy has a network of friends and not really wishing to get to know
        them in this compromised condition. "All right. I remember the flarebloom and soulfire the other day mentioned,
        right. I hope I don't keep you dragged behind or anything. I'll, yeah, try to hike with you through whatever.
        Rocky terrain is fine. Even if I only have sandals, they're a pretty good fit for this kind of thing. As long as
        rocks don't get lodged under my heel." He moves his hand to the side of the chair, feels around for the lever,
        and then pushes it forward, lifting Anya, Shape, and the chair forward. He holds the petite Anya partway so that
        she doesn't fall off of him. And then he brushes some of her hair from her eyes. "Just grab your chocolate on
        the way out." As they make a bit of room getting out of the vehicle, Shape grabs his key like before and this
        time his phone. He locks the car when they've both stumbled out.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>Chocolate. Mmm.</p>

      <p>
        Anya makes sure to take the chocolate and achieve another nibble of it before carefully stashing it into a
        jacket pocket. Certainly handy, these pockets! Being out of the car means that he can finally stretch out his
        limbs properly which is what he does, quite impressively so.
      </p>

      <p>"Do you need to visit the house of trading for product to have some food or are you fine in that regard?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Oh, sure, yeah. I'll just buy some breakfast," He says. He asks you to give him a moment, and he digs out his
        wallet again from the car, heads over to the gas station, and returns in a few minutes with a couple bagels and
        small packets of not-very-solid cheese and jelly. He spreads a plastic knife with some of this as he walks into
        the forest, gesturing Anya to follow. "And, again, if there's anything I can do to make this easier, I'll try,
        fairy hero."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        The fairy hops after Shape, after resisting becoming a Fairy to fly after him. She recalls how inconvenient it
        was to be tiny and cold yesterday. "I think I'll manage better than you but I'll see if it comes up! Maybe I
        need someone taller than me to reach a thing since I'm not as easily able to fly right now."
      </p>

      <p>
        The two of them head loosely in the direction they came from, some of their own tracks still visible along the
        way. Anya seems to occasionally stop and observe, listen. As if there's something she's looking for.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape eats all of one bagel, and he offers half of the second bagel to Anya to try with any curiosity. He
        remains patient through Anya's lead and search, not the first time Shape would just go with someone else's lead
        and never going to be the last. He asks Anya somewhere where the canopy is particularly tall and dark, "Oh,
        where could we find some fresh water? We might need that soon too."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya gnaws upon the bread some, seeming quite content, but finally stops to swallow his bite. She motions for a
        bit of quiet. She whistles three sharp tones out into the forest, then repeats them.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We can get some water soon, sure. You don't have any... Allergies, do you? Just to be sure." She munches some
        more bagel.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "I'm not allergic to anything, nah. I guess if I ever found something I'm allergic to, I could probably figure
        out how to rewrite something about my body to prevent that. But that's not really happened." He faces out where
        the whistles went, blinking violently. "Echolocation? Outbound calls?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        "Oh, I'm just looking for a messenger, to aid my cause. A friendly and good one. You might like him." There's a
        brief silence, and then Anya turns to look past Shape. "Ah, there we go."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Fluffs_w">
      <p>"Mrow."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape turns around and is met by a cat. "Ah, right, like a furry friend. Kinda quaint." He waves at it, and he
        steps aside a bit. Anya knows what to tell the cat, and cats are scratchy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>Anya leans down and gently pats the cat between the ears. It mrows contently.</p>

      <p>
        "So, Fluffs, I need you to bring a message to Nala, okay? I know you're just a cat and won't understand the
        words I tell you so." She instead conjures another of her small magical glowy sprites, this time in a warm red
        color. She mumbles a few words into it and gently lowers it onto the cat, where it seems to hover around in
        close proximity to the fur even as the cat stops observing it and starts weaseling around Anya's legs. A cozy
        lil' creature, it seems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape smiles, and he approaches the two creatures only to hide behind a close and thin tree and peer again. This
        fairy magic had a very particular design and theme; it almost seemed more stable than other fairies. Perhaps
        this is what a fairy mastering their abilities appears like, orbs and orbs and more orbs?
      </p>

      <p>
        He waits for Anya to send off Fluffs with the message, and he rejoins the fairy to ask about where to next and
        where the message was being sent to, again. He also says, "Cute cat though."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya watches the cat trot off into the thick of trees, waving it goodbye, then addresses Shape again. "Next! I
        hope you have passable shoes. We need to go up a hill, a bit. There's a cave up the mountainside in... That
        direction." She points. "Someone there has fairly exclusive access to a very important part of this. I'll
        actually get to join you on the walk this once, usually I'd just hover up there."
      </p>

      <p>
        She jumps slightly in her spot, seeming quite lighter than usual as she falls back down. He's never been a fan
        of walking barefoot over stony terrain but it's less of an issue when mostly unheavy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Oh... Well." Shape rubs the back of his neck. "Yeah, just sandals. But it's alright. I've walked a lot before.
        Surely it won't be too bad... I'm doing it no matter what, so. Thank you for keeping me company for this though.
        Here." He reaches for Anya's hand, and he starts walking off in that general direction with him. "We'll have a
        lot to discuss, maybe. Let's also get some water on the way there, like you said we could?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        This part of the forest, while thick around them, is in this path just a little more lenient. It's so peaceful
        and undisturbed, and yet you get the feeling more than enough creatures have passed here in their time. "We'll
        pass by a spring before we do the climbing, the water is quite fresh there. Say, I'm curious. What brings a
        shapeshifter to these parts anyhow? Well, apart from the needing a fairy to fix some oopsies, of course. I don't
        see many magical beings stop by, the ones I know generally live here already."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape's seen some wilderness only rarely in adventures. This place must have a biodiversity only short of the
        Amazon, judging from the variety of interesting small plants, some of which Shape would almost want to scan for
        magic. "Well, to be honest, I've been all over the place for most of my life. Almost a decade ago I settled down
        not too far away from the forests and mountains here, like a plains town with humans and not much else. I live
        there because, well, it's safe, it's small, even inexpensive. I've had trouble in the past just finding a home."
        He squeezes Anya's hand.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        The thick slowly clears up again, and soon ahead of them lies a bit of a grassy clearing against the base of the
        rocky hills - It's a striking view and the fairy points out a small, snaky trail that leads upwards. "Hmm...
        Inexpensive. I'm really not familiar with how you- the humans tend to do this money thing. I was going to say
        that I don't pay for my lil' treehouse but I guess I did actually make it myself. I... Did actually seek out a
        good few places myself before I came here. Nowhere else offers quite this variety of resources and life and the
        people here are very nice too. I can actually help most of the time when people need me... I don't think I could
        have helped you out if you visited any of my former homes." The thought itches a slight bit. Anya picks up a
        rock as they leave the grassy terrain, if just to distract herself from those implications.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Money is... Yeah. It was like started up basically because of wanting to normalize bartering systems into
        something more abstract. So, yeah, if a guy wanted five bundles of wheat and another guy was only selling sheep
        for it, he'd get way too much wheat if doing a fair deal, you know? So... Money made it easier to sort of buy
        the exact amount of wheat he wanted, I guess. Did that make sense? I'm not big on the money thing either, but I
        make it work." Shape takes a deep breath as they reach a steeper path. You could roll down with a bad fall. He
        gazes at Anya. "I'm glad you can help everyone, not just me, here. And I have to admit your tree house was
        pretty cute looking. I just sort of rented my home... Which is like giving money to justify occupying space
        until you leave. The people here are nice?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya simply gives some thoughtful nods to this notion of a bartering system. It kind of makes sense... Until the
        rent part comes up. But he's not eager to argue that. She gently puts the rock back down again, slightly further
        up the path. She trails off to the side as they pass an alcove in the hillside, which upon closer inspection
        seems to be partially cut out by hand, if roughly. Out of the back wall trickles a small stream of water, down
        into a crudely shaped bowl of sorts which currently is overflowing and spilling onto a small groove drawing the
        water aside. It's surprisingly refined of a system for how little effort into reshaping nature has been done,
        fitting the nature of this place as a whole. "It's usually quite cold, but it's good water." She dips her hands
        in and scoops some out, drinking it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape keeps close to the rock wall, afraid he might slip on a particular bit of loose gravel. At the irrigation
        into a drinking fountain of sorts, Shape nods and reaches for the bowl after Anya finishes her own drink. He
        manages to drink less water than her for his first go, but he cleans up the act for subsequent carries and sips.
        He says, with a wet shirt collar, "I prefer room temperature water, yeah. This will do, though. This is really
        quite fresh." He intentionally rubs some water onto his own face, and he then gives the bowl space, still
        keeping close to the rock wall and Anya secondarily when they continue on their way. "Where I'm at, people are
        nice, but there's only so many that are magic or that I can trust. I actually often have to meet visitors for
        that kind of thing now."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Before they leave, Anya quickly scoops a majority of the water out of the bowl. It slowly starts filling back up
        again. "Bit of a common courtesy. It's not like the water gets a wasted and it makes sure it's fresher for the
        next person." He shakes his hands off, making sure that there's minimal left before wiping them on the borrowed
        Jacket. "Aww... That's a bit of a shame. Well, you're. Certainly welcome to stop by here later on if you feel
        like it." Anya hops over a fairly big rock, and soon their goal starts coming into view. It's unassuming at
        first, but on top of a somewhat prominent overhang there's a cave, which judging by the sunlight falling deep
        into the entrance seems to be facing almost directly south. It's closing in on noon. "We came here at the right
        time, it seems. Ophelia's bound to be in a good mood and easy to find. She... well. She feeds off sunlight. It's
        been pretty nice weather for a few days. Now, remember to be on your best behavior. We need her assistance for
        something she has." As we round the corner, the cave really doesn't seem that deep at all. In the back, there's
        a shimmering pool of water. And... Apart from some smaller offshoots and alcoves, the place seems empty of life.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape says, "Yeah. I just might. If you're so sweet, your friends probably are too. Could make good day trips
        out of this. Maybe figure out a sleeping arrangement in a camping tent if I can figure out where I put that old
        kit." And, later, he puts his hands on his knees and breathes in, and he says, "Okay... That's good. I needed to
        maybe chill for a bit anyway. Possibly away from the very warm sunlight, unlike Ophelia here. Like in some more
        shade again, you know... I'll be nice, I promise." Shape continues toward the cave at Anya's discretion, slowly.
        He has to wonder if Ophelia is maybe hiding or away from home, given the totally empty nature of the cave and
        all... He smiles anxiously, and he puts his hand over where Anya's orb of warmth rests under. "I really hope
        she's here."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya giggles, and walks over to the pool of water that spans the back end of the cavern. There's an assortment
        of larger rocks around it, and she motions to the shaded area behind one of the taller ones. "She's always here,
        silly. It's not like she can just leave. You just need to... know where to look." She takes a small rock,
        attaches a glowing orb to it and drops it into the water. The orb follows the rock down. If Shape were to step
        closer, he'd see that there's much more to it than one would expect - The pool is considerable deep, an
        extension of the cave itself that goes quite deep, and there's an eerie glow in many different colors down in
        the depths. And a more purplish speck of that glow starts to move, up, towards the surface.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Ophelia_w">
      <p>
        It doesn't take long for the figure causing the glow to breach, a pair of glowing purple eyes peering out from
        the surface before drifting over to the shore. Ophelia leans her arms on the side of the pool, resting against
        it and giving Anya a quick glance before eyeing over the stranger beside him. She appears to be somewhat of a
        mermaid-y nature, but more... plantlike.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Ah, Anya. I was planning to take a sunbath anyways, it's such a nice day. I see you have company! Who might you
        be, then?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Where to look?" He says, as he retreats to the shade and gazes into the pool to his astonishment. Something
        tells him that he shouldn't hang in the deep end, but despite that he takes off his sandals and dips his toes
        into the water, having a proper seat on the side. But, with Ophelia's greeting, Shape quickly pulls his feet out
        and smiles awkwardly. "Oh, hey, Ophelia, Anya was just telling me about you and uh. Yeah I'm Shape, I've come
        around to the grove because I had a horrible thing happen where my heart's been frozen by a pretty nasty ice
        spell. The only reason I'm doing alright right now is because of something temporary, but Anya and I were
        looking for a more permanent solution, and I guess this watering hole had an important ingredient for the
        spell?" Shape, holding his wet toes, stares at Anya for clarification. And he says anyway, "I like your hair,
        also... Are you a mermaid? That's amazing."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya is quite amused by how flustered and surprised Shape is being, and simply interjects. "Yeah, he got himself
        into an oopsie and now I'm trying to save his life. Y'know, usual fairy stuff. Concentrated soulfire will do the
        trick, so I politely request a rubium shard. Preferably a higher grade one, this really isn't your everyday
        hex".
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Ophelia_w">
      <p>
        The mermaid seems, as predicted, reasonably cheerful and smiling warmly as the sun is now washing over her face.
        "Oh, you're a curious one. You've come to the right place! I cultivate crystals of many sorts in these waters,
        the magical essence in this lake is highly potent and likes to solidify if given the right seed to gather
        around. It's certainly a good pastime considering I live here full-time. I am indeed some manner of mermaid,
        though I think you'll find the more common myth ones to be more... meaty. Let's not get too existential, but I
        am pretty sure I was just a regular kind of plant until all this magic essence got to me."
      </p>

      <p>"I do have to ask though, what's your bargaining power like?" She stares at Shape, expectantly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Yeah! Thanks fairy. That's the stuff." Shape just wishes he had a towel to dry his feet with while listening
        about this remarkable underwater crystal garden of sorts, and its plant mermaid... He puts his hand, once more,
        over where Anya's orb of warmth is as Ophelia talks about 'bargaining power.' "I have to say, Ophelia, I'm just
        glad we have wonderful cavern ladies such as yourself, plant or meat. Forgive me maybe, I promise I'm not
        totally naïve to magic circumstances, I just haven't met a mermaid before. Anyway..." He runs his index finger
        and thumb on his cold lips. And he nods. "I'll bargain. I really could use your generosity, and I'm a desperate
        and kind person. So I'll do or give what I'm capable of here..." Hopefully within reason. "I don't have much on
        me physically, unfortunately."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Ophelia_w">
      <p>
        Ophelia and Anya simply laugh in unison. As if there's a joke that Shape simply isn't in on. "It's funny every
        time, isn't it? I really don't have high prices and getting to do what I just did is almost a payment in and of
        itself though. But if you do have anything- Oh, that'll do nicely." She says, noting the fairy holding up half
        her remaining chocolate bar. "It's hard to come by good snacks in a mountain cave, and while I only need light I
        do appreciate a treat on occasion."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        Anya hands over the bit of chocolate, and then turns to Shape. "I would have warned you, but she's right. It's
        very funny. If you want to raise the monthly candy delivery you'll owe me slightly, I'll make sure she gets some
        of it too."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape laughs sort of after they do, very concerned until he isn't. He just puts a palm on his forehead and
        smiles. "Yeah, Ophelia, I'll happily get you some chocolate or whatever else other candy you'd like monthly!
        That's fine. I already owe Anya anyway, she really snuck that one on me. Devious. Maybe just make sure to relay
        Anya about if you want a specific kind a month in advance so I can prepare it for next time." It's beyond Shape
        how she'd end up processing chocolate if her main intake is sunlight, but that's a question for another day. He
        leans forward on a rock facing the pond. "Well. Just know I'm happy to talk over the sweets then and there
        probably as well. I could really use more friends. But yeah, anyway."

      <p>
        As Ophelia dips away to search for appropriate magic rock, Anya shuffles over to Shape and leans against him.
        She takes the now lesser amount of chocolate, and nibbles on it again. "I can't tell if you're truly this
        excited to do this much nice things to people, or if it's due to the whole being mortally in danger thing. But
        it's very sweet. It'll be nice to have you around on occasion, truly, I almost want to say you don't have to
        return if you don't want to. But I guess it's a selfish desire to make you show up again." She rubs a hand
        against the back of her neck. "I, uh... Like you, I suppose."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape finds great ease in wrapping both arms around Anya, thinking back on last night once more. He says with a
        tender stillness, "It's a healthy mix of both. I do like helping people, and I really should live at least a bit
        longer to achieve that. I'm happy to make sacrifices for those important to me. So, yeah, I'll get your
        chocolate. I really do want to return to the Grove for you in particular." He pushes Anya's hand aside for a
        moment, locking his fingers with his. "I like you too. Nobody's ever really saved my life and really meant to. I
        think... And do you remember us in the car..? You're gorgeous where it matters most." He sort of laughs to
        himself, then, and admits, "Maybe I like that you're selfish about keeping me around. At least that we're being
        honest about what we want."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        The warmth that Anya shares with Shape blooms once more; it had already been thawing over the last moments but
        there's a distinct heat that fills the both of them right now. "You're... Ah. You're so nice. I look forward to
        it all, and..." She closes her eyes, and, for a moment one could almost forget the cold entirely. She swiftly
        leans in and kisses Shape on the lips. It's planned to be just a peck but once she's connected, she finds it
        hard to pull away again. The delightful heat of her emotions quelling the cold doesn't help.

      <p>
        Having quietly breached just a moment ago, Ophelia realizes it's maybe a bad moment to disturb and simply
        lingers at the surface, watching quite curiously.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        Shape lifts his arms for a short moment, caught in surprise, and then he returns them to wrap around the fairies
        torso once things settle in. Her warmth, on her lips and in her orb inside him, made the moment more than
        special. He rubs into his back and sustains the kiss for many more seconds, and when he finally breaks the two
        of them apart, he says, "I... Wow, I really look forward to it too. You're amazing." He smirks awkwardly at the
        watchful Ophelia, and he says, "I didn't come in expecting this, it just sort of happened." When he turns back
        to Anya, though, he winces and puts a hand on his own chest again.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Anya_w">
      <p>
        As soon as the Fairy has come back to her senses again, she flushes deeply red and hides her face, especially
        upon realizing Ophelia is back. She doesn't make any efforts to slink away though. "Sorry, sorry, aaahh... Oh!
        Are you okay? :( We really should get going, we can do... More of that afterwards. Maybe. Do you have the
        object, Eli?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Ophelia_w">
      <p>
        "Yes, I have what you need. It's a prime variant, but you two look like you deserve it." She carefully places a
        softly glowing red shard onto the shore, the shape of it almost looking like it was manually cut and not grown
        in a pool.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Shape_w">
      <p>
        "Yeah. I'm alright." He closes and opens his eyes, and lets go of his chest. His breath, though, has a bit of a
        frosty breeze. "Mm. You're right though. We should get going. Unfortunately. Thank you Ophelia that's really
        nice of you—." Shape walks over to the red shard and lifts it up. He walks away from the shore and in the
        direction of the cave entrance, looking back at Ophelia apologetically. "I'd stay longer and chat if this wasn't
        more urgent. Come on, Anya, let's... Yeah."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Ophelia_w">
      <p>She understands, and simply smiles and waves slightly towards Shape.</p>

      <p>"You better save him, Anya. He's cute. You two smooching, that's cute. Would be a shame to lose that."</p>
