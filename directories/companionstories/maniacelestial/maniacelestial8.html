			The elevator descends from Heaven. Mania lugs in her arms an impression of early 21st century Times Square
			drawn by the late Tiziano Vecellio, and she bumps Maddie's head by accident.
		<p>
			“Where should we hang this? Besides the water cooler?” Or the empty gallon drum, anyway.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, neat. That one's from the early 21st century! I really liked those years a lot. Vecillio did a great
			job with this one!"
		<p>
			Maddie walks over to the cooler, gently pushing it aside to make room for the painting.
		<p>
			"Yeah, this spot looks good. I think it'll be a nice addition to the apartment. Really livens it up a bit,
			you know?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Gideon_w">
		<div class="wrap Mania_w">
			<p>
				A chilly voice says, “This is an office building.”
			<p>
				Mania slides the painting onto the floor, and her hands pose like gnarled claws. She searches cubicle
				after cubicle, which causes a minority of imps to get back to their dull work.
			<p>
				“Who the Hell are you?”
			<p>
				“Gideon. You're correct to assume you're in trouble, Magdalena Neale. Colloquially Mania. There are
				Rules.”
			<p>
				A person stands in the hallway leading to the elevator. Their physical form could be seventeen years old
				or it could be seventy. They're holding a gray blob that shivers in their white gloves. They nod at
				Maddie when she stares. An imp grins by Gideon's knees, too.

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie stares at the figure, shock and worry on her face.
		<p>
			"G-Gideon? What are you doing here?"
		<p>
			Even with her limited knowledge of Hell, Maddie isn't clueless. Gideon is the overseer of Hell, and their
			presence here is most likely a dire issue.
		<p>
			Maddie detects a strange aura from Gideon. It's extremely powerful, but not demonic. It's clouded and
			obfuscated, making it impossible to determine what they truly are.
		<p>
			"Please don't harm her. I'm just trying to help her, please..."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Gideon_w">
		<div class="wrap Mania_w">
			<p>
				Mania's voice lowers and she backs into a glass wall. The scenic view of crimson rock sprawls behind
				her.
			<p>
				“—Fuck. I didn't mean it, Gideon, whatever I did. I'll work you with you here. Level with me.”
			<p>
				The Demon of Fate walks toward Mania. They then appear in front of her without so much as a blur or
				whistle. They points backwards at the imp that came with them.
			<p>
				“Your imp of your servitude Jase Bush reported your visitations in Heaven. This reached me. Your Spatial
				Elevator Interference ability has a remarkable oversight. Kuma and then I were unaware of the
				infrastructure in Heaven permitting this loophole until Now. You abused it.”

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie continues to watch, her fears now confirmed.
		<p>
			"It's my fault! I was only trying to show her heaven so she'd finally let go... I just wanted to help get
			her out of here. Hasn't she suffered for long enough?"
		<p>
			Maddie gives Gideon a pleading look, deeply concerned for her friend and partner.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Gideon_w">
		<div class="wrap Mania_w">
			<p>
				Gideon turns their attention to Maddie. Mania closes her eyes, and she cries while muttering swears. Her
				power and wealth are Chance cards and Monopoly money to Gideon.
			<p>
				“You're of Good Intention, Angel Maddie. Understand Magdalena understood her transgression and agreed to
				pursue it to a logical extreme. There are now consequences.”
			<p>
				The jiggling mass in their hands leaps up and assaults Mania's wrists and ankles, plummeting her to the
				floor. The four components condense into metal clamps that lock her free movement away. And Gideon
				teleports her elsewhere.
			<p>
				They continue, “You're an excellent Savior.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"What? I'm doing a good job? You just shackled her and took her away! She's barely gotten anywhere with
			actually helping her, she's still arrogant and stubborn. I feel like I've failed in every regard."
		<p>
			Maddie looks sadly at where Mania used to be, tears in the corners of her eyes.
		<p>
			"How is this doing excellent? Will I even get to see her again?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Gideon_w">
		<p>
			“Her aura is weakening. Her confidence is shrinking. Her focus is shifting.”
		<p>
			Gideon presents Maddie another gray blob. It morphs into a common GPS and navigation instrument accurate to
			the millimeter. It registers Mania's location.
		<p>
			“She was once Unsalvageable.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie's fear is now replaced with curiosity at Gideon's words.
		<p>
			"How do you know all of this? What even are you? You don't seem to be a demon..."
		<p>
			She takes the GPS, looking down at the screen intently.
		<p>
			"How long is she going to be there? I'm assuming I'm allowed to visit her, right? You wouldn't be giving me
			this if that wasn't the case."
