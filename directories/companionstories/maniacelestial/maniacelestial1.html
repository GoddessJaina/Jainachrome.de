    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        High above the shining white streets of a bustling city awash with golden heavenly sunlight, a woman steps off
        of the elevator to the sixteenth floor of a skyscraper, one with pale blue windows and made from white bricks
        lined with gilded carvings. It's immediately apparent that this is no human soul: this is an angel. Her pure
        white hair has a halo atop it, floating above a pair of similarly white cat ears. Behind her, four feathery
        wings are currently folded in, and a two-tipped white cat tail waves behind her. Her outfit consists of pale
        blue office wear, with a dark skirt and a glowing ID in her shirt pocket. She fumbles for a moment, and pulls
        out the ID as she steps up to a large desk that faces away from the glass wall of the room, where an angelic
        woman with four arms sits at a chair, with papers and a computer in front of her. She looks up to see who
        entered the room, a pair of glasses in front of two glowing golden eyes. The cat-angel presents her ID, and
        speaks.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hello, it's Maddie, as requested. I assume I'll be given the details as to why I was called up here today?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Generic_w">
      <p>"Yes. Welcome, one named Maddie. You have been called here because we have found your Assumer."</p>

      <p>
        She pauses, either to allow the lesser angel time to experience an onslaught of excited emotions or for herself
        to consider her next words. She grabs from the middle of the papers with two hands just the right one, and two
        other palms face up to the ceiling with two other arms. An important gesture.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Your Assumer has existed for hundreds of years by this time, actually. It's not unusual, one named Maddie, for
        this to occur. We will send you to the Mortal Plane to speak with her where we have found her. It soon will
        likely not be possible to speak with her again for many years. Please represent your learned values and
        understanding to your Assumer."
      </p>

      <p>She presents the piece of paper to Maddie. It's an address.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        With a mixture of excitement and confusion, Maddie takes the paper, holding it carefully as if it was a winning
        lottery ticket.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Thank you, Archangel. I'll be on my way to meet her as soon as possible. Is there anything else needed of me?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Maddie fidgets with her tie, clearly resisting the urge to bolt and head to the Mortal Plane as soon as
        possible. She is curious as to why her human has been around for so long and why it is so time sensitive, and
        burns with the desire to find out.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Generic_w">
      <p>"Yes. Please conceal your true identity to your Assumer for the initial meeting period."</p>

      <p>
        The Archangel is repeating standard wisdom on the ceremonial practice of a celestial being meeting their
        Assumer. It's maybe a little annoying, then, but nothing more. Concealing one's identity to their Assumer at
        first is important because it creates a grace period devoid of biases.
      </p>

      <p>"You may now please hurry."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie nods and turns back, heading into the elevator. As she goes down, in a flash of golden light, her halo
        and wings disappear, and her outfit is changed to a pair of jeans, with a light gray t-shirt with the logo of a
        popular human band on it. A leather purse is slung over her shoulder, and she wears a silver bracelet. Her cat
        ears and tail, unlike her wings, remain. She takes a brief walk down the street, arriving at a train station.
        She boards a train bound for a city in the Mortal Realm. The train, seemingly normal at first, takes a
        ninety-degree plunge downwards, although to passengers, no turbulence is felt. About twenty minutes later, the
        train phases into a station in the Mortal Realm, although human onlookers act as if nothing out of the ordinary
        has happened. Maddie steps out, and begins walking towards the listed address.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Generic_w">
      <p>
        This human station is dirty and rampant with scuffs in the concrete. It's a stark contrast from the pearly
        celestial train. Billboards for bubble tea and a processed, orange corn product are even faded.
      </p>

      <p>
        The crowd is suffocating, too, and continues even into the narrow streets itself. But many small businesses are
        thriving, at least, because of the rush hour. Decorative paper lanterns dangle from wires.
      </p>

      <p>
        The address is actually for a fine dining establishment. It's packed, too, and there's a long wait-list.
        Thankfully, however, Maddie has an innate sensation unlike anything she's felt until now. All celestial beings
        have a form of "soul connection" to their Assumers, after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        And her Assumer is a curvy woman in a suit brandishing her fork like a weapon and cursing at a portly man in
        front of her.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Both excited and nervous, Maddie slowly makes her way to her Assumer, immediately curious as to why such a
        normal looking human would be hundreds of years old. She cautiously makes her way over, waiting for the woman to
        finish her verbal assault upon the man.
      </p>

      <p>Maddie walks up next to her Assumer, nervously trying to get her attention.</p>

      <p>
        "H-hi. Ma'am, can I speak to you for a moment? It's quite important. Sorry if I'm interrupting something. But
        it's very important."
      </p>

      <p>Maddie fidgets a bit, her tail waving nervously as she awaits a response from the highly attractive woman.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        The portly man faces Maddie first, and he says something gentle and confused in Chinese. The woman says
        something else in Chinese to him with a bile forming in her throat, and then she faces the catgirl to spout
        perfect English.
      </p>

      <p>"Get the hell out of here."</p>

      <p>
        She digs out of her purse a business card and shoves it into Maddie's chest. The card reads, "Maria Flecheloo.
        Venture Capitalist, CEO of Ulterior Inc." It's then followed by the string "1-666-1776."
      </p>

      <p>
        And Maria has already resumed talking to the man, this time putting her fork down and speaking his language in a
        lower voice. She's eaten nothing from her expensive plate. And apparently cat ears don't interest her.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>Maddie turns to the man, and her eyes momentarily shift from a deep brown to a shining golden color.</p>

      <p>"You're welcome to leave now. Please, child, do so."</p>

      <p>
        The man, although seemingly not able to understand English, somehow perfectly interprets this, then turns around
        and walks away. Maddie turns back to look at 'Maria.'
      </p>

      <p>"Okay, Now that that's dealt with, we. Need. To. Talk."</p>

      <p>
        All shyness is gone from Maddie's voice, replaced now with a slight frustration at being pushed away by the
        woman. Angels weren't used to having people act so rude to them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        Maria stands up abruptly from her chair and glares at the man walking away, and she yells after him probably
        some heinous threats. Then, she finally maintains her attention, undivided, to the angel. She also grabs
        Maddie's wrist.
      </p>

      <p>
        "You scared my fucking client away! Who do you think you are? The only 'child' here is you—just tell me what
        your damn reason is. You want my services? Are you a humanitarian? Are you stupid?"
      </p>

      <p>
        She smiles and then frowns and then smiles again. She walks with Maddie out of the restaurant and into the
        lively street, not interested in leaving this place with nothing having been accomplished.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>Maddie turns to the woman, her tail waving back and forth in annoyance.</p>

      <p>
        "Okay, you're going to tell me who the hell you are, and why you've been alive for over two hundred years.
        You're supposed to be long dead. Humans don't live that long."
      </p>

      <p>Maddie glares at her, her white ears twitching.</p>

      <p>
        "As you can clearly see, I'm not a normal person. And also what the hell is up with your phone number? That's
        not standard formatting for any region of the world."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        "Oh, you definitely have me mistaken for somebody else. Perhaps my mother, or my grandmother, who shared my
        company and likeness."
      </p>

      <p>She twists Maddie's wrist slightly. She refuses to glare into her eyes now.</p>

      <p>
        "I'm wealthy, idiot. I can maintain a unique phone number. Anything else you're going to waste my time with? I
        don't care that you are a cat, if that's what this is about."
      </p>

      <p>
        She pauses, and then lies, "Oh, I know. Tell me what you want and who you are, and then I'll tell you who I am."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie's eyes again flicker for a moment, turning golden for a second, and then red for a nearly imperceptibly
        short moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Yeah, you're not old, and I'm Walter Hartwell White. I can tell you're lying, you know. You've been around for
        centuries. Also, on the phone thing. There's still systems in place to keep phone numbers standardized. You
        can't just pay your way into that. Trust me, I know a lot about administrative work. It doesn't work like that."
      </p>

      <p>Maddie takes a deep breath and stares at Mania, slightly calmer now.</p>

      <p>
        "Look, I was supposed to meet up with you and figure out more about you. Why are you hiding everything from me
        like this? And lying through your teeth?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        Mania does see Maddie's eyes change color, despite herself. She takes them toward the nearest set of office
        buildings. She pulls harder and walks faster.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Are you trying to threaten me? You aren't the first person to try and find out the truth about me, you know.
        And yet I tell people all the time. You see, when I tell people, that's not something to be happy about. It
        means you're going to agonize and die, and maybe you'll even suffer forever afterwards too. I'm more pissed off
        that you fucked up my meeting with my client."
      </p>

      <p>She stretches her back, and she then clutches both of Maddie's shoulders. They keep walking.</p>

      <p>
        "So, what are you, a magical forest elf? An oracle? Just a living lie detector? Are you really that sure that
        you want to keep this up with me?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie chuckles at the mention of "dying" and "suffering forever." The very idea that such a mortal consequence
        could happen to her is amusing.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Honestly, I could ask the same of you. You probably aren't human anymore, even if you were at some point. You'd
        be long dead from old age. And please, drop the threats, they're quite ironic."
      </p>

      <p>
        Maddie tilts her head for a second, thinking. One ear pokes up while the other flattens down, reflecting her
        head tilt.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Anyways, what's this about a 'client'? What kind of deals do you even make, with your supposed company? Should
        I just call the phone number you gave me and ask there? It's probably easier to just tell me now."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>"You got me: I found the Fountain of Youth."</p>

      <p>She rolls her eyes.</p>

      <p>
        "Don't bother calling the phone number—it rings directly to me. I don't have the luxury of competent
        secretaries, remarkably. No, I'll just explain my business myself. I could even break a deal with you, free of
        charge—like, really free of charge, since you're so invested. So, tell me, stranger: Is there anything you want
        more than anything else but just can't seem to ever have? I can help you reach that goal. I'm not shitting you,
        either."
      </p>

      <p>
        They enter into the office building's front lobby. Mania lets go of Maddie, sits on a nearby chair, and holds
        her forehead and winces for a searing headache.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Hmmm... what do I really want right now? Well... could you please pat my head? Just pet me a bit like a cat? I
        really enjoy that and I haven't had the chance to get some pats in a while."
      </p>

      <p>
        Maddie looks at Mania with an adorable pleading expression, her ears flattened down like a kitten begging for a
        treat.
      </p>

      <p>"I think that would be a good deal. I get my head patted, and you get to pat my head."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        Mania waits for Maddie to make a real request, but the real request never arrives. She would just leave into an
        elevator on the spot, never to be seen by Maddie again, but it would be better to terminate this loose end that
        is this cat girl.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, frustrated, Mania removes a black binder from her purse and a red ballpoint pen. She hastily writes
        something on a piece of weathered parchment paper, and she then holds out the pen and parchment for Maddie to
        take.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the words on this contract are eloquently written in cursive—the agreement that Maddie should get her
        head patted by Mania and where it says to sign on the dotted line. Most of the contract, however, is a much
        smaller font that is hard to read clearly. The fine print changes and distorts anytime Maddie looks away or
        blinks.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Whatever... My business is that clients can sign my contracts and I then will help them achieve their goals.
        Sign, 'Child'."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie carefully peers at the page, reading the fine print. It's unclear whether she's even noticed that the
        text is shifting, and even if she has, it doesn't seem to bother her. After finishing reading over it, she nods
        at the woman, and simply signs "Maddie" at the bottom.
      </p>

      <p>"Yeah, that looks about right. My headpat now, if you will?"</p>

      <p>
        Maddie's tail wags with anticipation as she hands the parchment back to the woman, seemingly undisturbed by the
        contents of the fine print.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        Mania crumbles the contract up into a ball and throws it on the ground. She puts the pen in her purse, though.
        She keeps losing those things, so they're worth their weight in uranium isotopes.
      </p>

      <p>"You really are an idiot, Maddie, for signing my contract after threatening me."</p>

      <p>
        She laughs, and she pets the cat girl on her head to the cat girl's perfect preference. It's the best head pat
        of all time, with even some scratches behind the ears... For a mortal, it'd be the start of a downward spiral,
        as the dark arcane forces of hell itself would make the mortal hopelessly obsessed with recapturing that
        fleeting, immaculate sensation and spend all their time and resources fruitlessly chasing it until their
        negligence renders them to a slow, inevitable death...
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie closes her eyes at the touch, calmly enjoying the pats. Her ears twitch at the scritches, and she even
        purrs softly as Mania's gentle touch hits all the right spots.
      </p>

      <p>After the patting is finished, Maddie opens her eyes, and looks at Mania.</p>

      <p>
        "Thank you for that. That was quite satisfying. You are pretty good at following through on your contracts! I
        might be interested in further dealings, that was enjoyable."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        Mania frowns at Maddie's answer. She glances at the crumpled contract, and she stiffens up. She stands up and
        grabs Maddie again, only to shove her onto the floor, too. Mania's contracts have barely ever failed on a client
        before. There had to be a horrific reason for it this time.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Aren't you going to beg me for more? Where's your damn enthusiasm?—What the hell are you? Just go fuck
        yourself!"
      </p>

      <p>
        She storms off to the elevator in the lobby. As soon as she enters it, the wall and floor become this kind of
        cheap, stained, and red wallpaper and carpet. And she presses the elevator button to go down several times.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie gently pats the woman's head, the same way she had her own head patted moments ago. She's inexplicably
        standing in the elevator behind Mania, waiting for her to turn around after pressing the buttons.
      </p>

      <p>
        "You really think you'd be able to avoid answering me that easily? Come on, I'm really not trying to cause that
        much trouble. I just wanted you to answer my questions. What are you? And what was up with me 'begging for
        more'? It was just a headpat. I like 'em, but they're not addicting or anything."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        Mania grabs Maddie's arms and intends to rip them off despite not being the kind of demon particularly talented
        at ripping limbs off torsos.
      </p>

      <p>
        The elevator doors close, and the elevator descends deeper and deeper. It's too humid and all too warm before
        long. And Mania jumps, and her feet land on the ceiling. She stands on the ceiling as if it is the floor, and it
        becomes clear why as soon as the elevator doors open again.
      </p>

      <p>
        They've departed into the narrow hallway of an inverted office floor, complete with some accompanying inverted
        cubicles, furniture, and decorations.
      </p>

      <p>
        A big, cracked glass window shows a mostly dark, rocky, and desolate place with warm magma pouring from the
        ceiling in places.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mania pulls away from Maddie, staring at her as she walks backwards, on the ceiling, into a cubicle. Only the
        fax machine makes noise for a while.
      </p>

      <p>
        "You've really given me no option, you asshole... I'm Mania. The CEO of Hell. Now it's your turn. Tell me what
        you are."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Hm. Well, now that you've answered my questions, and I know what you are. I'll uphold what I said. I'm an
        angel."
      </p>

      <p>
        As Maddie says this final word, her halo and wings reappear in a flash of golden light, and she floats up, not
        touching the floor or ceiling of the bizarre structure.
      </p>

      <p>"I'm here to meet you, because you're the one who created me."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>"That's... Impossible."</p>

      <p>
        A slurry of emotions pepper the demon, most of which have been absent for at least years. She rips the stapler
        from its glue on the desk and tosses it down at Maddie.
      </p>

      <p>
        "You're lying! I'm a fucking demon, there are no angels for me! There never has been, never will be, you fucking
        liar. And the audacity to suggest I've somehow made you—gave creation to you, made you real?"
      </p>

      <p>She screams out at her, and she throws her purse at her too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        The stapler harmlessly bounces off of Maddie, and she simply gives Mania a disappointed look. She realizes that
        Mania may be a bit of a challenge to save.

        "Please, calm down. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to end your eternal torment. It's not going to end today.
        Or this year. But I will save you, as is my duty. Don't you want to be free?"
      </p>

      <p>Maddie gives her a pleading look, trying to reason with the panicked demon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        "Bullshit!" She continues. Her voice is this awful, rashy thing when it raises like this. "If you can free me,
        just do it already, bitch. Kill me once and for all or get out of my sight!"
      </p>

      <p>
        A comically short demon peeks his head in from a neighboring cubicle, although his sense of gravity is the same
        as Maddie's and he seems confused and excited. Two more of these demons, very similar in their naked appearance,
        then also float in from a nearby hallway.
      </p>

      <p>
        One says, "How the fuck is an angel here?" Another follows, "I thought those were dead too." And the last says,
        "I hear they explode into guts if they stay here too long!"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>Maddie is momentarily distracted by the arrival of the imps, and her eyes light up.</p>

      <p>"Oh my god if you aren't the most adorable little hellspawn I've ever seen!"</p>

      <p>Maddie turns to Mania, her head tilted.</p>

      <p>
        "You didn't tell me your employees were this cute! I'm going to have to come down here more often. Also because
        helping you feels like it will be... a long process."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Mania_w">
      <p>
        "Imps, grab her and escort her back into the elevator. You're all ugly. Don't listen to her. She's very foolish.
        Frankly, she's ugly too."
      </p>

      <p>
        She frowns and steps away from the cubicle. She stares into the angel's eyes with incredible disgust—admittedly
        not for her appearance, though, but for what she claims to stand for.
      </p>

      <p>
        The imps make an embarrassing effort even after some others join in trying to shove Maddie away, so Mania
        resorts to simply entering a door labeled with "CEO of Hell" on a plaque.
      </p>

      <p>An imp says, "I dunno, I used to shoplift a hell of a lot. I don't think I'd be here if that was cute!"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie closes her eyes and breathes deeply, ignoring the imps for a moment. When she finishes, she scribbles
        something down on a piece of paper, then looks down at the imp.
      </p>

      <p>"Oh nooo, I must run and leave now or these terrifying imps will destroy me!"</p>

      <p>
        Feigning terror, she walks back to the elevator, giggling as she walks away. She boards the elevator, presses a
        button, and then waves goodbye to the imps as the door slides shut.
