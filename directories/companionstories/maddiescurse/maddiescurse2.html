		<p>
			Vera awakens a couple hours later to the sound of the door opening and the smell of freshly cooked steak as
			Maddie reenters the room. She seems to have gone in and out silently while Vera was sleeping as Maddie is
			currently wearing an apron that says "KISS THE COOK" that she probably had stored in the small wardrobe. The
			‘COOK’ is crossed out and ‘cat’ is written under it in rough handwriting.
		<p>
			"Food's ready! Wake up, sleepyhead, take a seat at the table. Do you want some water with it? I got a bunch
			of water bottles while I was there."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera groans. It's like visiting her mother in Italy. She sits up, and a tiny smirk then crosses her lips,
			the first Maddie has seen. She sits at the table soon.
		<p>
			"Smells better than I considered it would. Did you season this, Maddie?—I would enjoy water to drink, yes.
			Thank you for feeding me."
		<p>
			The golden light from the ceiling of the station is mostly dimming now. They would be enveloped by moonlight
			or total darkness soon.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yes, of course I seasoned it. Just because I don't really participate in society doesn't mean I'm a
			barbarian. It's pretty good, right?"
		<p>
			Maddie pours out a bottle of water into a glass, and sets it at the table.
		<p>
			"I'd say the steak came out pretty good." she says while chewing.
		<p>
			Maddie and Vera finish the meal, and Maddie pulls out a garden hose from where it's clipped to the ceiling,
			and opens a window. She begins spraying the plates clean with the hose, holding the plates out of the window
			so the water spills down to the gravel below the train.
		<p>
			"You should really sleep for the night, I plan on doing it soon too. You can use the mattress; I'll curl up
			on the floor or something. Don't worry."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera confesses the steak is delicious. She's always had a slightly more carnivorous diet than some of her
			peers.
		<p>
			Sitting back on the mattress, Vera rotates her tablet in her hands and presses some of its discreet buttons.
			She sighs and places it back into her sash. And she grabs a tattered blanket she's been avoiding. Night is
			coming with a chill.
		<p>
			"I understand, Maddie, that you live here because it's inexpensive? I'm concerned it's missing some
			amenities. And, anyway, I have another question, probably more important. Why did you bring up the anecdote
			about the stray cat? I can't stop thinking about it. It seems—mundane."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I don't know. I guess it reminded me of my current situation. I kind of just live out in the city, I'm also
			a cat to some degree. Maybe I remember the bite so well because it kind of reminds me of how I sometimes
			have a bit of a negative response to people. Like you saw. But I think you should go to sleep now. You can
			worry more in the morning..."
		<p>
			Maddie yawns, stretches, and then curls up in a large cardboard box in the corner of the room. It's padded
			with blankets and old cushions and to Vera looks surprisingly comfortable.
		<p>
			"I'm going to sleep now. See ya in the morning."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Alright. Thank you for answering me. I find this interesting. Goodnight."
		<p>
			Vera lies still in the bed, patiently expecting Maddie to fall asleep while wracked with thoughts. Any
			attempt to sneak out would be probably foiled by the shoddy door for the subway car and Maddie's cat-like
			senses. That alone would be acceptable, maybe, but she doesn't want to destroy her image of being compliant
			and possibly harmless to someone who has quickly thrown her off her feet before. She could rummage quieter
			than the door hinge through Maddie's possessions, then. Although it is less delving into some deep insight
			for her job and more, well, acting petty to her captor.
		<p>
			So, Vera rolls onto her side, staring at the wall long enough that she can relax enough to fall asleep
			again. She despises sleeping in the same room as others.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			--------------------
		<p>
			When Vera awakens in the morning, she is immediately greeted by the sight of the catgirl looming over her,
			staring down at her.
		<p>
			"Finally, you're awake. I've been waiting for you to wake up for a while now. I think you look pretty cute
			like this, honestly."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Goosebumps form all across Vera's skin, and she reels backwards onto the pillow, her hair falling over her
			eyes.
		<p>
			"What? Please don't do that! S-Staring at me while I'm sleeping, or saying that, I'm referring to."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, that's not what I meant. I think you'll find what you see to be pretty funny, actually."
		<p>
			Maddie pulls out a scratched old hand mirror with a slight crack in the middle. As Vera gazes into the
			mirror, to her horror, she has a pair of cat ears atop her head, her human ears gone. The ears are the same
			color as her hair, and have a bit of fluff to them.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			All the color from Vera's face drains, and she screams in a higher octave than she'd ever speak. She
			snatches the mirror off of Maddie and pats down where her human ears used to be and where these new ones
			apparently are, shivering at the weird sensation of the fur not at all analogous to her other human
			features.
		<p>
			"What the hell have you done to me? Change me back! Please, you—lunatic, why?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well... that was the whole thing with the bite."
		<p>
			Maddie giggles.
		<p>
			"I'm cursed! Why do you think I would've mentioned being bitten by a weird stray cat, and then biting you
			afterwards? You were asking so many questions about me, I figured the best way to show you would be to bite
			you and let you figure it out firsthand. In hindsight, that probably wasn't the best way to go about doing
			it, but it's pretty funny so I don't regret it."
		<p>
			Maddie reaches down to Vera and pets her new tail.
		<p>
			"Oh yeah, you have this now. It's actually pretty fun to have, I think you'll come to enjoy it! Also, I'm
			not entirely sure how to, uh, uncat you. You're pretty smart though so I'm sure you'll figure out how."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera shakes her head over and over, and her black, sleek tail awkwardly dips away from Maddie's touch. She
			stands up from the bed, then, and paces around the room, her hands curled into fists.
		<p>
			"Of course you're cursed—why didn't I think of that? Don't answer that, I don't want to hear it. You're
			right: this is far from the best way you could have shown me your personal history. I've engaged with too
			many magical beings playing tricks on me—and now this innocent assignment has transformed me into a cat
			person! I'll never hear the end of it. I'm figuring this out immediately. I'm not okay with this."
		<p>
			She sits down abruptly on the smaller of the two chairs. She closes her eyes. "What do you know about
			turning me back to normal?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hey hey hey, calm down a bit! I really don't know how to change you back. I just got bitten by that cat one
			day when I was a kid and just... lived with it ever since. I'm not too sad over it, it really isn't bad.
			Plus being able to see well in the dark is neat!"
		<p>
			Maddie opens a cooler with another cooler inside of it, with an even smaller cooler inside of that one,
			eventually pulling out a miraculously still frozen breakfast sandwich, which she unwraps and puts in the
			microwave.
		<p>
			"Here, have some breakfast. We can try to figure out a solution when you're less hungry."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Maddie, I'm an adult woman with a job for a guarded society. Even if they allow me back inside its borders,
			I'll be mocked forever. Forever. I don't want this."
		<p>
			The visual comedy of the coolers is lost to Vera. She unfurls her fists so that she can press her face into
			her palms. Her new left ear twitches.
		<p>
			"Give me kibble and milk, that'll cheer me up. That's a lie. Just... Okay, let's work together. You're my
			best odds here. Please."
		<p>
			Vera takes the sandwich at the soonest opportunity from the microwave. She eats it quickly, although she ate
			a lot last night too.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie paces around the room, and stops to look out the window at the morning sun shining through a hole in
			the ceiling.
		<p>
			"Well, you said you've dealt with magical creatures a lot before, right? Surely you've dealt with a cursed
			person before; do you have any experience with fixing something like that?"
		<p>
			Maddie pulls out a slightly stale chunk of bread and begins munching, as she moves over to the other chair
			and sits facing Vera.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera sighs. She'd rather not bother with finding something to brush her hair with. She stares at Maddie.
		<p>
			"No. No personal experience, I mean. Shape has told me anecdotes of people with curses, and what I
			understand is that they are inconsistent. Magic, at large, is inconsistent. If we find the right person it
			could be trivial to fix or essentially impossible. However, how do we find the right person? I can't even
			contact Shape. He's been missing for about two months. I doubt that's changed. And some curses are based on
			time. I don't want to wait and be trapped like this or have it become worse."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie puts an elbow on the table, and then rests her chin on her palm, thinking.
		<p>
			"I really don't know how the curse works. I've only spread it to one other person before you, and it was how
			I learned about the way it spreads. A couple years ago I met this girl, and she hung out with me for a while
			one evening... things escalated a bit, and, uh, I kind of bit her. She really wanted me to bite her, we were
			having a nice time together. If you know what I mean."
		<p>
			Maddie, clearly lost in thought, stares off into space for a moment.
		<p>
			"I hope she's doing well. I miss her. But in terms of knowing who actually can fix this... not a clue. Why
			don't we go outside and get some fresh air now that you've calmed down. We can take a walk through the city;
			it'll be fun!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Your story is appreciated, Maddie. I wish, however, it gave us more information we could work with. I
			suppose it informs us that we should not bite someone. Maybe this curse spreads through blood? Shape always
			tells me his blood carries his magic."
		<p>
			She buries her head into her arms on the table. Her tail drags down.
		<p>
			"There's no chance I'm going outside in a public space like this. I wouldn't for fun, either. You'll take me
			straight to somewhere where we can begin to investigate who can help me. And I'll need a big coat to
			hide—this."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Meh. I don't really bother hiding it; people just assume I'm just a person who thinks it's funny or cute to
			walk around like I'm cosplaying a catgirl. I make sure no one can see under my hair and realize that I don't
			have human ears. As long as I keep my tail down so it looks like it's fake. It's a bit awkward, but hey,
			better to have people think I'm just crazy than for them to realize I'm both crazy and unnatural!"
		<p>
			Maddie digs around the wardrobe, pulling out a beanie and a large raincoat. She walks over to Vera and tries
			to pop the hat onto her over her ears, but it falls off.
		<p>
			"Hm. This might be a bit of an issue. Not quite sure what to do with your ears. Although you look so
			adorable like this I think you should just rock the look."
		<p>
			Vera's ears perk up reflexively upon being told she looks ‘adorable’.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Flattery will not improve my mood about any of this, Maddie. You did this to me, after all."
		<p>
			Vera also tries fitting the beanie on herself. And, while the raincoat prevents her tail from being obvious,
			there's still the impression of a tail on its fabric.
		<p>
			Vera grimaces, showing her teeth. Four of her existing teeth became savage fangs overnight.
		<p>
			"I hope nobody will recognize me. I don't really feel like going, but I need to find help."
		<p>
			She stands up and steps outside the door, maintaining a stare at the ground. Her white uniform has stains
			from sleeping on the old mattress with it.
		<p>
			"We can go. Lead me downtown, please. Lie about who I am when necessary today."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hmm. We'll need to think of a fake name for you. We can do that later, though. When we go out, mostly keep
			to quiet streets and alleys. The less people, the better."
		<p>
			Maddie grimaces slightly with discomfort as she pushes her tail under a much smaller coat than Vera's and
			with ease that comes from years of practice. Then, she puts on a headband with holes for her ears so it
			looks like she's wearing fake cat ears.
		<p>
			"Alright, let's get going. Downtown shouldn't be too hard to reach; it's only about a 20 minute walk away."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She nods, and they head back into the abandon section of the subway where they had their first encounter.
		<p>
			The city is still crowded with the same traffic from yesterday, and even the side alleys are populated. Vera
			stands close behind Maddie in order to dissuade onlookers from closely examining her cat ears, and she
			sometimes bumps into Maddie. One man sitting at the steps to a set of doors flicks his cigarette by her
			feet, and Vera then pushes Maddie forward. She's not anywhere near as confident as yesterday.
		<p>
			"Is there a library or university nearby? I would envision magic users congregating there..."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I don't usually go into places like that very much, as you could probably guess. I think there's a library
			in the downtown, but I'm not exactly sure where. I remember passing by it a few times, it looks like it's
			half castle and half modern glass box. Neat place."
		<p>
			Maddie looks around, checking down some alleys seemingly searching for something.
		<p>
			"Maybe if we can get onto a rooftop it'll be easier to find. I hope you like climbing!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Good idea. A building resembling a castle should capture the imagination of young magic users, at least. I
			assume you're not an avid reader? Where do you frequent here instead?"
		<p>
			Vera shakes her head, and she leans on a brown wall. Her tail curls away in her raincoat.
		<p>
			"Can't we just ask someone where the library is? I'm not climbing a big ladder. At least find us a
			stairwell."
		<p>
			She stares up at a metal awning.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Ladder? Stairwell???"
		<p>
			Maddie lifts her hands and curls her fingers slightly, showing her sharp, slightly oversized nails, a little
			reminiscent of a cat's claws.
		<p>
			"I just climb the walls. There's usually enough little protrusions and the like to do so. But if you really
			want to be boring, yes, I suppose we could just ask someone."
		<p>
			Maddie glances around, looking for a suitable passerby.
		<p>
			"Vera, you seem great at introductions. Go ask that lady over there for directions to the library."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera frowns. She examines her own fingers, and she exhales seeing that her fingernails haven't changed.
		<p>
			"I don't want to climb any walls. I can't, see? Okay, I will be boring as you claim and ask her. Please just
			stand nearby."
		<p>
			She approaches the older lady, and she waves with stiff muscles. The stranger glances behind Vera
			inexplicably, and then she says, "What?"
		<p>
			"Hello. I'm new to this area. Do you know where the library is? I have been informed it's half castle and
			half modern décor."
		<p>
			"Go that way. Take a right at the breakfast café." She walks away and her wrist shakes as she retrieves her
			purse from her shoulder.
		<p>
			Vera shrugs toward Maddie. "I believe she meant forward from here?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah, that makes sense. I don't usually get such a cold reaction, maybe I'm just more trustworthy looking
			than you."
		<p>
			Maddie gives a mischievous grin.
		<p>
			"I'm very trustworthy, you know. I would never do something rash and dangerous."
		<p>
			Maddie begins walking down the street following the directions, turning back to make sure Vera is following
			her.
		<p>
			"C'mon, let's go check out the library. You're the one who wants to go there so badly after all. Although
			it'd be nice to stop at the cafe. I'm kinda thirsty."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera rolls her eyes and follows after Maddie.
		<p>
			"I suspect you're just fortunate with who you talk to. However, I'm here trying to trust you, so maybe you
			just are trustworthy, despite your appearance. Anyway, a drink of water could help us, yes. I won't need to
			show my identification, but if someone asks for who I am—the story is I'm Carrie, and that I'm visiting the
			area. Evidently, as well, I like cats. Unless you have a better lie?"
		<p>
			They arrive by the glass door to the cafe. She grabs Maddie's shoulder, delaying her from entering and
			allowing a young couple to slip out.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie waits for the couple to pass by and then continues on into the cafe. Then, realizing she doesn't have
			any money and that Vera probably wouldn't approve of stealing, she turns to her and quietly asks her,
		<p>
			"Hey, uh, v- Carrie, you're going to pay, right? I don't exactly have any money on me."
		<p>
			Then, without even waiting for a response, she gently grabs Vera's arm and leads her to the cashier, clearly
			just wanting Vera to get on with it so she can get her drink.
		<p>
			"Hiii can I get uhhh medium frozen hot chocolate?"
		<p>
			Then, she turns to Vera, waiting expectantly for her to order something.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She nods, and she faces the cashier with little fuss. That's what the money is for.
		<p>
			"I'll take a black coffee. Two cups of water in addition. The order is for Carrie."
		<p>
			The woman takes their order and Vera's cash, staring at their cat ears. She folds her hands and smiles.
		<p>
			"Oh, is the convention happening again already?"
		<p>
			Vera hazards a guess. "We wanted to—wear the costumes early."
		<p>
			"They look good! They look cute."
		<p>
			Vera turns away and says, "Okay." She sits down at an empty little table nearby, and she shies from Maddie's
			attention.
		<p>
			"This is really embarrassing..."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie sits down next to her, and she smiles at Vera.
		<p>
			"I don't know, I think you look pretty cute wearing cat ears too. It's not that embarrassing, come on."
		<p>
			Maddie leans back, relaxing while she waits for her drink.
		<p>
			"Do you drink anything more exciting than black coffee? It's kind of boring in my opinion. Why don't you try
			something else for once? You seem to be having a lot of success trying out new horizons lately."
		<p>
			Maddie giggles, clearly enjoying teasing Vera.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera shakes her head, but her ears flick once and her tail stands and waves for several seconds.
		<p>
			"I'm not like that, Maddie. I'm not trying to be cute. I'm not trying to excite anyone. That's not the point
			of any of this. This costume is too many problems. And, please, it is bold of you to assume I don't ever
			order other caffeinated drinks... Are you familiar with the energy drink?"
		<p>
			She returns a weak, but genuine, smirk. Hers are fleeting.
		<p>
			"I persisted with those during my career training courses."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie cocks her head, thinking.
		<p>
			"Hmm... I'm not sure if I've had one of those before. Actually, maybe that one time a few years ago when I
			had 13 cans of some drink in one afternoon and I couldn't stop moving for the next day and a half. Those
			might've been energy drinks."
		<p>
			Maddie looks and notices that their order is ready. She walks over, picks up the cups, and then sits back
			down and passes Vera her drink.
		<p>
			"I like hot chocolate. It's just tasty, there's not much more to it."
		<p>
			Maddie then takes a big slurp from her straw, clearly enjoying it immensely.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"You could have died, you know. You're only supposed to enjoy a maximum of three of those a day. One would
			be more medically acceptable... Read what the contents of the can are next time."
		<p>
			She sips from her coffee. She plants her elbows on the table, and she watches Maddie's glass empty.
		<p>
			"Black coffee is okay. Really, I simply need caffeine in the morning, and I don't have much of a 'sweet
			tooth'... Drink your water."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I usually drink water. It's very accessible, compared to something like this. Plus if I drank hot chocolate
			consistently I'd probably end up dying getting the microwave plugged in. It's dangerous work, but very
			rewarding."
		<p>
			Maddie continues to slurp, not caring in the slightest about the obnoxious noise the straw is making.
		<p>
			"Caffeinated things tend to just make me a bit too hyper. I usually try to avoid them."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"You're reasonable when you want to be, Maddie. I believed you were simply ignorant to the fire hazard that
			thing posed, but now I know you're simply reckless in favor of treats. Likewise, you're right to avoid that
			family of drinks."
		<p>
			Vera's new ears are more sensitive, so she downs her cup of water and then sidesteps from the table with her
			coffee.
		<p>
			"We're done talking. The library will help us end this soon enough. 'This' being this costume."
		<p>
			She leads them around the corner outside the cafe. The impressive glass box area of the library is close,
			after all.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie gives a smile and a wave to the cashier before following Vera outside.
