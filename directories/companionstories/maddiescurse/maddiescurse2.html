			Vera awakens a couple hours later to the sound of the door opening and the smell of freshly cooked steak as
			Maddie reenters the room. She seems to have gone in and out silently while Vera was sleeping as Maddie is
			currently wearing an apron that says "KISS THE COOK" that she probably had stored in the small wardrobe. The
			‘COOK’ is crossed out and ‘cat’ is written under it in rough handwriting.
		<p>
			"Food's ready! Wake up, sleepyhead, take a seat at the table. Do you want some water with it? I got a bunch
			of water bottles while I was there."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera groans. It's like visiting her mother in Italy. She sits up, and a tiny smirk then crosses her lips,
			the first Maddie has seen. She sits at the table soon.
		<p>
			"Smells better than I considered it would. Did you season this, Maddie?—I would enjoy water to drink, yes.
			Thank you for feeding me."
		<p>
			The golden light from the ceiling of the station is mostly dimming now. They would be enveloped by moonlight
			or total darkness soon.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yes, of course I seasoned it. Just because I don't really participate in society doesn't mean I'm a
			barbarian. It's pretty good, right?"
		<p>
			Maddie pours out a bottle of water into a glass, and sets it at the table.
		<p>
			"I'd say the steak came out pretty good." she says while chewing.
		<p>
			Maddie and Vera finish the meal, and Maddie pulls out a garden hose from where it's clipped to the ceiling,
			and opens a window. She begins spraying the plates clean with the hose, holding the plates out of the window
			so the water spills down to the gravel below the train.
		<p>
			"You should really sleep for the night, I plan on doing it soon too. You can use the mattress; I'll curl up
			on the floor or something. Don't worry."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera confesses the steak is delicious. She's always had a slightly more carnivorous diet than some of her
			peers.
		<p>
			Sitting back on the mattress, Vera rotates her tablet in her hands and presses some of its discreet buttons.
			She sighs and places it back into her sash. And she grabs a tattered blanket she's been avoiding. Night is
			coming with a chill.
		<p>
			“I understand, Maddie, that you live here because it's inexpensive? I'm concerned it's missing some
			amenities. And, anyway, I have another question, probably more important. Why did you bring up the anecdote
			about the stray cat? I can't stop thinking about it. It seems—mundane.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I don't know. I guess it reminded me of my current situation. I kind of just live out in the city, I'm also
			a cat to some degree. Maybe I remember the bite so well because it kind of reminds me of how I sometimes
			have a bit of a negative response to people. Like you saw. But I think you should go to sleep now. You can
			worry more in the morning..."
		<p>
			Maddie yawns, stretches, and then curls up in a large cardboard box in the corner of the room. It's padded
			with blankets and old cushions and to Vera looks surprisingly comfortable.
		<p>
			"I'm going to sleep now. See ya in the morning."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Alright. Thank you for answering me. I find this interesting. Goodnight.”
		<p>
			Vera lies still in the bed, patiently expecting Maddie to fall asleep while wracked with thoughts. Any
			attempt to sneak out would be probably foiled by the shoddy door for the subway car and Maddie's cat-like
			senses. That alone would be acceptable, maybe, but she doesn't want to destroy her image of being compliant
			and possibly harmless to someone who has quickly thrown her off her feet before. She could rummage quieter
			than the door hinge through Maddie's possessions, then. Although it is less delving into some deep insight
			for her job and more, well, acting petty to her captor.
		<p>
			So, Vera rolls onto her side, staring at the wall long enough that she can relax enough to fall asleep
			again. She despises sleeping in the same room as others.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			-----------------
			<br>
			When Vera awakens in the morning, she is immediately greeted by the sight of the catgirl looming over her,
			staring down at her.
		<p>
			"Finally, you're awake. I've been waiting for you to wake up for a while now. I think you look pretty cute
			like this, honestly."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Goosebumps form all across Vera's skin, and she reels backwards onto the pillow, her hair falling over her
			eyes.
		<p>
			“What? Please don't do that! S-Staring at me while I'm sleeping, or saying that, I'm referring to.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, that's not what I meant. I think you'll find what you see to be pretty funny, actually."
		<p>
			Maddie pulls out a scratched old hand mirror with a slight crack in the middle. As Vera gazes into the
			mirror, to her horror, she has a pair of cat ears atop her head, her human ears gone. The ears are the same
			color as her hair, and have a bit of fluff to them.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			All the color from Vera's face drains, and she screams in a higher octave than she'd ever speak. She
			snatches the mirror off of Maddie and pats down where her human ears used to be and where these new ones
			apparently are, shivering at the weird sensation of the fur not at all analogous to her other human
			features.
		<p>
			“What the hell have you done to me? Change me back! Please, you—lunatic, why?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well... that was the whole thing with the bite."
		<p>
			Maddie giggles.
		<p>
			"I'm cursed! Why do you think I would've mentioned being bitten by a weird stray cat, and then biting you
			afterwards? You were asking so many questions about me, I figured the best way to show you would be to bite
			you and let you figure it out firsthand. In hindsight, that probably wasn't the best way to go about doing
			it, but it's pretty funny so I don't regret it."
		<p>
			Maddie reaches down to Vera and pets her new tail.
		<p>
			"Oh yeah, you have this now. It's actually pretty fun to have, I think you'll come to enjoy it! Also, I'm
			not entirely sure how to, uh, uncat you. You're pretty smart though so I'm sure you'll figure out how."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera shakes her head over and over, and her black, sleek tail awkwardly dips away from Maddie's touch. She
			stands up from the bed, then, and paces around the room, her hands curled into fists.
		<p>
			“Of course you're cursed—why didn't I think of that? Don't answer that, I don't want to hear it. You're
			right: this is far from the best way you could have shown me your personal history. I've engaged with too
			many magical beings playing tricks on me—and now this innocent assignment has transformed me into a cat
			person! I'll never hear the end of it. I'm figuring this out immediately. I'm not okay with this.”
		<p>
			She sits down abruptly on the smaller of the two chairs. She closes her eyes. “What do you know about
			turning me back to normal?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hey hey hey, calm down a bit! I really don't know how to change you back. I just got bitten by that cat one
			day when I was a kid and just... lived with it ever since. I'm not too sad over it, it really isn't bad.
			Plus being able to see well in the dark is neat!"
		<p>
			Maddie opens a cooler with another cooler inside of it, with an even smaller cooler inside of that one,
			eventually pulling out a miraculously still frozen breakfast sandwich, which she unwraps and puts in the
			microwave.
		<p>
			"Here, have some breakfast. We can try to figure out a solution when you're less hungry."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Maddie, I'm an adult woman with a job for a guarded society. Even if they allow me back inside its borders,
			I'll be mocked forever. Forever. I don't want this.”
		<p>
			The visual comedy of the coolers is lost to Vera. She unfurls her fists so that she can press her face into
			her palms. Her new left ear twitches.
		<p>
			“Give me kibble and milk, that'll cheer me up. That's a lie. Just... Okay, let's work together. You're my
			best odds here. Please.”
		<p>
			Vera takes the sandwich at the soonest opportunity from the microwave. She eats it quickly, although she ate
			a lot last night too.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie paces around the room, and stops to look out the window at the morning sun shining through a hole in
			the ceiling.
		<p>
			"Well, you said you've dealt with magical creatures a lot before, right? Surely you've dealt with a cursed
			person before; do you have any experience with fixing something like that?"
		<p>
			Maddie pulls out a slightly stale chunk of bread and begins munching, as she moves over to the other chair
			and sits facing Vera.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera sighs. She'd rather not bother with finding something to brush her hair with. She stares at Maddie.
		<p>
			“No. No personal experience, I mean. Shape has told me anecdotes of people with curses, and what I
			understand is that they are inconsistent. Magic, at large, is inconsistent. If we find the right person it
			could be trivial to fix or essentially impossible. However, how do we find the right person? I can't even
			contact Shape. He's been missing for about two months. I doubt that's changed. And some curses are based on
			time. I don't want to wait and be trapped like this or have it become worse.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie puts an elbow on the table, and then rests her chin on her palm, thinking.
		<p>
			"I really don't know how the curse works. I've only spread it to one other person before you, and it was how
			I learned about the way it spreads. A couple years ago I met this girl, and she hung out with me for a while
			one evening... things escalated a bit, and, uh, I kind of bit her. She really wanted me to bite her, we were
			having a nice time together. If you know what I mean."
		<p>
			Maddie, clearly lost in thought, stares off into space for a moment.
		<p>
			"I hope she's doing well. I miss her. But in terms of knowing who actually can fix this... not a clue. Why
			don't we go outside and get some fresh air now that you've calmed down. We can take a walk through the city;
			it'll be fun!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Your story is appreciated, Maddie. I wish, however, it gave us more information we could work with. I
			suppose it informs us that we should not bite someone. Maybe this curse spreads through blood? Shape always
			tells me his blood carries his magic."
		<p>
			She buries her head into her arms on the table. Her tail drags down.
		<p>
			"There's no chance I'm going outside in a public space like this. I wouldn't for fun, either. You'll take me
			straight to somewhere where we can begin to investigate who can help me. And I'll need a big coat to
			hide—this."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Meh. I don't really bother hiding it; people just assume I'm just a person who thinks it's funny or cute to
			walk around like I'm cosplaying a catgirl. I make sure no one can see under my hair and realize that I don't
			have human ears. As long as I keep my tail down so it looks like it's fake. It's a bit awkward, but hey,
			better to have people think I'm just crazy than for them to realize I'm both crazy and unnatural!"
		<p>
			Maddie digs around the wardrobe, pulling out a beanie and a large raincoat. She walks over to Vera and tries
			to pop the hat onto her over her ears, but it falls off.
		<p>
			"Hm. This might be a bit of an issue. Not quite sure what to do with your ears. Although you look so
			adorable like this I think you should just rock the look."
		<p>
			Vera's ears perk up reflexively upon being told she looks ‘adorable’.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Flattery will not improve my mood about any of this, Maddie. You did this to me, after all."
		<p>
			Vera also tries fitting the beanie on herself. And, while the raincoat prevents her tail from being obvious,
			there's still the impression of a tail on its fabric.
		<p>
			Vera grimaces, showing her teeth. Four of her existing teeth became savage fangs overnight.
		<p>
			"I hope nobody will recognize me. I don't really feel like going, but I need to find help."
		<p>
			She stands up and steps outside the door, maintaining a stare at the ground. Her white uniform has stains
			from sleeping on the old mattress with it.
		<p>
			"We can go. Lead me downtown, please. Lie about who I am when necessary today."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hmm. We'll need to think of a fake name for you. We can do that later, though. When we go out, mostly keep
			to quiet streets and alleys. The less people, the better."
		<p>
			Maddie grimaces slightly with discomfort as she pushes her tail under a much smaller coat than Vera's and
			with ease that comes from years of practice. Then, she puts on a headband with holes for her ears so it
			looks like she's wearing fake cat ears.
		<p>
			"Alright, let's get going. Downtown shouldn't be too hard to reach; it's only about a 20 minute walk away."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She nods, and they head back into the abandon section of the subway where they had their first encounter.
		<p>
			The city is still crowded with the same traffic from yesterday, and even the side alleys are populated. Vera
			stands close behind Maddie in order to dissuade onlookers from closely examining her cat ears, and she
			sometimes bumps into Maddie. One man sitting at the steps to a set of doors flicks his cigarette by her
			feet, and Vera then pushes Maddie forward. She's not anywhere near as confident as yesterday.
		<p>
			“Is there a library or university nearby? I would envision magic users congregating there...”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I don't usually go into places like that very much, as you could probably guess. I think there's a library
			in the downtown, but I'm not exactly sure where. I remember passing by it a few times, it looks like it's
			half castle and half modern glass box. Neat place."
		<p>
			Maddie looks around, checking down some alleys seemingly searching for something.
		<p>
			"Maybe if we can get onto a rooftop it'll be easier to find. I hope you like climbing!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Good idea. A building resembling a castle should capture the imagination of young magic users, at least. I
			assume you're not an avid reader? Where do you frequent here instead?”
		<p>
			Vera shakes her head, and she leans on a brown wall. Her tail curls away in her raincoat.
		<p>
			“Can't we just ask someone where the library is? I'm not climbing a big ladder. At least find us a
			stairwell.”
		<p>
			She stares up at a metal awning.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Ladder? Stairwell???"
		<p>
			Maddie lifts her hands and curls her fingers slightly, showing her sharp, slightly oversized nails, a little
			reminiscent of a cat's claws.
		<p>
			"I just climb the walls. There's usually enough little protrusions and the like to do so. But if you really
			want to be boring, yes, I suppose we could just ask someone."
		<p>
			Maddie glances around, looking for a suitable passerby.
		<p>
			"Vera, you seem great at introductions. Go ask that lady over there for directions to the library."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera frowns. She examines her own fingers, and she exhales seeing that her fingernails haven't changed.
		<p>
			“I don't want to climb any walls. I can't, see? Okay, I will be boring as you claim and ask her. Please just
			stand nearby.”
		<p>
			She approaches the older lady, and she waves with stiff muscles. The stranger glances behind Vera
			inexplicably, and then she says, “What?”
		<p>
			“Hello. I'm new to this area. Do you know where the library is? I have been informed it's half castle and
			half modern décor.”
		<p>
			“Go that way. Take a right at the breakfast café.” She walks away and her wrist shakes as she retrieves her
			purse from her shoulder.
		<p>
			Vera shrugs toward Maddie. “I believe she meant forward from here?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah, that makes sense. I don't usually get such a cold reaction, maybe I'm just more trustworthy looking
			than you."
		<p>
			Maddie gives a mischievous grin.
		<p>
			"I'm very trustworthy, you know. I would never do something rash and dangerous."
		<p>
			Maddie begins walking down the street following the directions, turning back to make sure Vera is following
			her.
		<p>
			"C'mon, let's go check out the library. You're the one who wants to go there so badly after all. Although
			it'd be nice to stop at the cafe. I'm kinda thirsty."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera rolls her eyes and follows after Maddie.
		<p>
			"I suspect you're just fortunate with who you talk to. However, I'm here trying to trust you, so maybe you
			just are trustworthy, despite your appearance. Anyway, a drink of water could help us, yes. I won't need to
			show my identification, but if someone asks for who I am—the story is I'm Carrie, and that I'm visiting the
			area. Evidently, as well, I like cats. Unless you have a better lie?"
		<p>
			They arrive by the glass door to the cafe. She grabs Maddie's shoulder, delaying her from entering and
			allowing a young couple to slip out.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie waits for the couple to pass by and then continues on into the cafe. Then, realizing she doesn't have
			any money and that Vera probably wouldn't approve of stealing, she turns to her and quietly asks her,
		<p>
			"Hey, uh, v- Carrie, you're going to pay, right? I don't exactly have any money on me."
		<p>
			Then, without even waiting for a response, she gently grabs Vera's arm and leads her to the cashier, clearly
			just wanting Vera to get on with it so she can get her drink.
		<p>
			"Hiii can I get uhhh medium frozen hot chocolate?"
		<p>
			Then, she turns to Vera, waiting expectantly for her to order something.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She nods, and she faces the cashier with little fuss. That's what the money is for.
		<p>
			"I'll take a black coffee. Two cups of water in addition. The order is for Carrie."
		<p>
			The woman takes their order and Vera's cash, staring at their cat ears. She folds her hands and smiles.
		<p>
			"Oh, is the convention happening again already?"
		<p>
			Vera hazards a guess. "We wanted to—wear the costumes early."
		<p>
			"They look good! They look cute."
		<p>
			Vera turns away and says, "Okay." She sits down at an empty little table nearby, and she shies from Maddie's
			attention.
		<p>
			"This is really embarrassing..."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie sits down next to her, and she smiles at Vera.
		<p>
			"I don't know, I think you look pretty cute wearing cat ears too. It's not that embarrassing, come on."
		<p>
			Maddie leans back, relaxing while she waits for her drink.
		<p>
			"Do you drink anything more exciting than black coffee? It's kind of boring in my opinion. Why don't you try
			something else for once? You seem to be having a lot of success trying out new horizons lately."
		<p>
			Maddie giggles, clearly enjoying teasing Vera.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera shakes her head, but her ears flick once and her tail stands and waves for several seconds.
		<p>
			"I'm not like that, Maddie. I'm not trying to be cute. I'm not trying to excite anyone. That's not the point
			of any of this. This costume is too many problems. And, please, it is bold of you to assume I don't ever
			order other caffeinated drinks... Are you familiar with the energy drink?"
		<p>
			She returns a weak, but genuine, smirk. Hers are fleeting.
		<p>
			"I persisted with those during my career training courses."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie cocks her head, thinking.
		<p>
			"Hmm... I'm not sure if I've had one of those before. Actually, maybe that one time a few years ago when I
			had 13 cans of some drink in one afternoon and I couldn't stop moving for the next day and a half. Those
			might've been energy drinks."
		<p>
			Maddie looks and notices that their order is ready. She walks over, picks up the cups, and then sits back
			down and passes Vera her drink.
		<p>
			"I like hot chocolate. It's just tasty, there's not much more to it."
		<p>
			Maddie then takes a big slurp from her straw, clearly enjoying it immensely.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"You could have died, you know. You're only supposed to enjoy a maximum of three of those a day. One would
			be more medically acceptable... Read what the contents of the can are next time."
		<p>
			She sips from her coffee. She plants her elbows on the table, and she watches Maddie's glass empty.
		<p>
			"Black coffee is okay. Really, I simply need caffeine in the morning, and I don't have much of a 'sweet
			tooth'... Drink your water."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I usually drink water. It's very accessible, compared to something like this. Plus if I drank hot chocolate
			consistently I'd probably end up dying getting the microwave plugged in. It's dangerous work, but very
			rewarding."
		<p>
			Maddie continues to slurp, not caring in the slightest about the obnoxious noise the straw is making.
		<p>
			"Caffeinated things tend to just make me a bit too hyper. I usually try to avoid them."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"You're reasonable when you want to be, Maddie. I believed you were simply ignorant to the fire hazard that
			thing posed, but now I know you're simply reckless in favor of treats. Likewise, you're right to avoid that
			family of drinks."
		<p>
			Vera's new ears are more sensitive, so she downs her cup of water and then sidesteps from the table with her
			coffee.
		<p>
			"We're done talking. The library will help us end this soon enough. 'This' being this costume."
		<p>
			She leads them around the corner outside the cafe. The impressive glass box area of the library is close,
			after all.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie gives a smile and a wave to the cashier before following Vera outside. Down the street, they see the
			library, the glass part facing the side of the street that they are on. They walk down the street without
			issue, Maddie silently following Vera as they approach.
		<p>
			"Aaand here we are! Boring building full of books. I'm not quite sure what we're actually going to find here
			that's helpful, but I'll just follow you around and act like I'm helping. I'm very helpful when I try."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			The library interior is massive. Rows of shelves have considerable distance in-between, and yet most genres
			are represented. A second floor is accessible by elevator and stairway, and off to the far left is the other
			large area of the library mimicking a European castle. Vera, however, laps the wall of this glass area,
			reading the several pinned papers and notes from employees as well as library visitors in the more dedicated
			bulletin boards. She sighs.
		<p>
			"My society has many bulletins resembling this one and even some digital examples. Unfortunately, much like
			theirs, I can locate no information pertaining to magic."
		<p>
			She asks the desk clerk if she can dial a phone number. It rings dead.
		<p>
			"Do you want to try something, Maddie?" The field researcher rubs her temples, frustrated.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Why don't we go look in the castley part of the library. That's where a wizard would probably be. I bet
			they'll be pondering an orb or something."
		<p>
			Maddie puts her hands together excitedly, clearly lost in the idea of meeting a stereotypical wizard.
		<p>
			"Maybe they'll have a magic staff and stuff! Maybe they'll even teach me how to be a wizard! Come on, let’s
			go look!"
		<p>
			Maddie pulls Vera by the arm towards the medieval-looking part of the library, so excited that her tail
			threatens to slip from the coat.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"I suppose that was the original plan we had in mind. However, allow me to interact first with any wizards
			we meet. I'm not convinced they will be as friendly to delve in their arcana as you believe."
		<p>
			She comes along by Maddie's side, then, amused by the catgirl's imagination. Vera had similar perceptions of
			what the magical world resembled when she was just starting her training. Modern, civilian books and movies
			are guesswork at best, it turns out.
		<p>
			The large room is dark and moody for a library, almost resembling a cavern more than a castle. There are
			frequent lamps that resemble candle lights by different chairs, sofas, and desks, however. Vera quickly
			resumes scanning the postings even across unlit sections of wall.
		<p>
			"You may grab a book if you want," She says.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie look around, seeing if there's anyone else in the room. Disappointed by the lack of wizards, or
			anyone in particular, she starts scanning the shelves. After a few moments, she stops abruptly while looking
			at the books.
		<p>
			"I just realized... it's been over 10 years since I last read a book. I'm not even sure if I remember how to
			read a book at this point..."
		<p>
			She walks over to Vera again, cocking her head in thought.
		<p>
			"You're a nerd, why don't you find a book."
		<p>
			Vera normally would easily be able to quickly look through the shelves and mentally pick out books that
			might be useful, but today she feels overwhelmed by the vast shelves of books. Concentrating in general has
			become harder as the morning has gone on, she has noticed.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera crosses her arms and shakes her head. With growing urgency, she then plucks out some books individually
			to read the title and back of. They're little use for her, even if she wasn't hexed.
		<p>
			“Maddie, I think I'm getting really stressed out, probably. Are we even in the right section...? None of the
			postings got me anywhere, so we'll need something else. Ideally a book discussing magic or a magic user.
			They must have something.”
		<p>
			Vera breathes in deeply and shoves the books arbitrarily into gaps in the nearest bookshelf. Most are not
			even in the right category anymore. She walks out of the aisle.
		<p>
			“Anyway, I'm sorry you might not be able to read books anymore. Furthermore, while reading is something I
			enjoy sometimes, I don't really intend my visit to last long enough to justify reading, for example,
			fiction.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie follows Vera out of the aisle, looking around for books that stand out.
		<p>
			"So... are we looking for books that look like they have arcane sigils or something on them? Magicy looking
			stuff?"
		<p>
			She looks up, and sees a deep purple book high on one of the shelves, about 10 feet off the ground. Rather
			than looking for a ladder, Maddie simply walks up and hooks her fingers around one of the shelves as if
			testing if it would topple if she climbed on it.
		<p>
			"Hm. That book up there looks magic looking. Want to go get that one? I can climb up, unless you want to go
			up and get it."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Yes, 'magic-y looking stuff,' as you would phrase it.”
		<p>
			Vera shares a toothy smirk up at the book Maddie singled out. She, too, places her hand on the shelf,
			lightly shaking it. It's firm.
		<p>
			“What kind of library keeps books on shelves that high? Just another example of our bad luck. No matter,
			I'll grab it.”
		<p>
			She closes her eyes, washing out this overstimulation of the library's offerings again. And she plants her
			shoes on top of an empty pocket of the lowest shelf off the ground. She's pleased, and she then drops a few
			novels and a manuscript onto the floor to make room for her next step up the shelf.
		<p>
			Unfortunately, while the shelf itself holds, its supports pop on both sides, and it crashes down to the
			ground with all of its contents in one brief flurry of pages.
		<p>
			“Why did I ever think that would work?” She grabs her own head and pulls on it. An audience of a few people
			gathers at the end of the aisle, including a library staff member. “Please, this can't be happening—”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie, watching the disaster unfold, reacts quickly. She grabs Vera's arm as she's panicking and begins to
			pull her with her, away from the growing group of onlookers.
		<p>
			"We have to get the fuck out of here, come on. I have no idea why you would do something that stupid, but
			please just move."
		<p>
			Maddie pulls her along, trying to escape the library as quickly as possible. Worried about moving in such a
			hurry, Maddie glances back at Vera and herself to check if their tails have accidentally poked out from
			under their coats. To her horror, Vera's tail, unaccustomed to being tucked beneath a coat, has slipped out
			from under it, waving far too naturally from the lower part of her coat. There are still people turning to
			see the commotion as they rush out of the library.
		<p>
			"Come on, let's just go. Keep moving please."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“You're the one who said I could go up and get it! Whose stupid idea was that?”
		<p>
			A low growl bubbles from Vera's throat, but she coordinates with Maddie's escape. They run through the front
			door of the castle themed area of the library, and they dart into a side alleyway after passing by a couple
			of small businesses.
		<p>
			She frowns, stares into Maddie's feline eyes, and pushes the woman backwards into a stumble. She watches her
			fingers curl up afterwards, like a paw.
		<p>
			“Maddie, I hate you. Obviously this curse isn't just a cosmetic change. And I could be stuck like this
			forever. I'm going to be, regardless, at this rate.”
		<p>
			She sniffles.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie catches her balance, and over at Vera, noting that her eyes now looked as feline as her own.
		<p>
			"I... I really didn't know it did that much. I didn't expect it to do so much to you. I don't even know
			where to begin on fixing this. I've never been able to so much as consider it, every day for me is just
			focusing on surviving until the next. I don't have a real home, I don't have a reliable source of food and
			drink. I just hope that I can keep living as I do. Biting you was a panic decision, I had to deal with you
			somehow and it was the fastest way to do that. I'm sorry if you get stuck like this. Maybe you'll just have
			to learn to live with it."
		<p>
			Maddie looks down, no longer willing to make eye contact. She takes a deep breath, trying not to succumb to
			Vera's infectious panic.
		<p>
			"But I do have to try to help you now. Both because if you get taken or whatever they'd do to a cursed cat
			person, they'll probably get me too. And also, because it's the least I can do after what I did to you. I'm
			sorry."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera rubs her eyes with her knuckles. She walks deeper into the alley, and she removes her raincoat. Her
			tail thrashes about.
		<p>
			“You don't seem to know anything, Maddie... I wish this could all be over like a bad dream. Regardless, I
			hear you, and—I'm going to make sure you have a lunch and dinner every day, as long as I'm here. You should
			be sorry, however. You should have done something else. I would have a hard time adjusting to this state of
			being. It'd take years. I'm not kidding you when I suggest I'm unsure I would be accepted home, either. Even
			if I lied about the infectious nature of my being, it wouldn't change that I know I could infect my peers
			someday. I'm not willing to put Town at risk of this curse. So I'm staying here unless—no, until I'm cured.”
		<p>
			She reaches the wall at the end of the alley. She grabs her own shoulders and slides her back down the wall.
		<p>
			“Just take me to the subway again and don't talk to me.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Alright... although we can't move through the street with you... like that."
		<p>
			Maddie gestures to Vera's tail, free from the coat and waving, reflecting Vera's motions and thoughts.
		<p>
			"We'll need to find an alternate way back. Maybe we can climb a building, and go across rooftops until we
			find our way back."
		<p>
			Maddie glances up, looking for a suitable section of wall to climb. She sees a fire escape a few feet off
			the ground, leading up to the roof on the fifth floor.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera gazes at the section of the wall Maddie notices, and she tilts her head. Moments later, however, Vera
			slumps even lower on the wall and grabs her forehead.
		<p>
			“No. I can't climb anything, Maddie, if I can't climb a bookshelf. We should just wait until it's less
			crowded outside.”
		<p>
			She closes her eyes and starts to lie across the asphalt. It's unpleasant.
		<p>
			She can't help but to see herself as a woman in a monster's skin. Shape has a point about first impressions.
			Maybe Vera should stay out of sight.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie paces back and forth across the alleyway, her own tail freed and waving back and forth, reflecting
			her motions.
		<p>
			"We're in the downtown part of the city. It's not going to become less busy anytime soon; we can't sit here
			all day long."
		<p>
			Maddie stalks over to the moping woman. She reaches down, and shakes her shoulder.
		<p>
			"Get up. Just because this sucks doesn't mean you can be so whiny. Honestly? This is stupid. Let's just walk
			back to the subway. It's a big city, no one will remember us or care in the slightest."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera grumbles and collects herself from the floor. She grabs her tail in her hand, studying it. It's not
			fluffy.
		<p>
			“I've earned the right to be whiny. I'm going to remind you that I don't really feel like talking, and that
			this is all your fault. Okay, though, let's walk back. Call me Carrie if anyone asks, obviously.”
		<p>
			The cat girl then walks back out of the alley, not waiting for Maddie. Her chin dips down, her face follows
			the sidewalk, and her hands move to cover her ears.
		<p>
			The crowd notices her. Most are too bewildered to respond more than staring or even reaching for their
			camera. Some strangers start shouting, however.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie rolls her eyes, remaining in the shadows of the alley for a moment longer before darting out of the
			alleyway, running towards Vera. She grabs her arm, pulling her with her away from the crowd of onlookers,
			down the busy street.
		<p>
			"You're just about as stupid as I am, huh. Come on, safety's not too far away. Just run with me."
		<p>
			Maddie pushes through crowds, not caring about the onlookers and running through active traffic, barely
			avoiding people and cars alike.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"I'm not an idiot!” Vera pants. She darts along with Maddie, somehow maintaining her quick pace. She presses
			down on her ears, and she tries to just focus on what's directly in front of them. She's threatened, again,
			by being overwhelmed...
		<p>
			Thankfully, no one at all halts them in their chaotic path to the subway entrance, and they slow down in the
			abandoned tracks leading up to Maddie's overgrown home. It's much brighter here in the tunnels than Vera
			remembers, however.
		<p>
			She tugs her arm away from Maddie. She wipes a tear from her eye and, after some minutes, she grabs a piece
			of equipment from the gravel. Her taser hasn't been confiscated or damaged. But she groans at it anyway.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			In the darkness, Maddie slowly and silently creeps up behind Vera, much like she did when they first met.
			However, this time, rather than grabbing her arm, Maddie gently puts a hand on top of Vera's head, patting
			and petting between her soft ears.
		<p>
			Normally, Vera would object to this sudden contact in such a situation, but it feels strangely calming and
			relaxing, and her worries, while not washed away, are eased.
		<p>
			Maddie simply stays with her, gently petting her head wordlessly, soothing her.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Her muscles deflate, then, and her head limps backwards into Maddie's hand. A confused smile grows from her
			tight lips. And she hardly walks forward at all.
		<p>
			The catgirl purrs and mews. Her tail grazes Maddie's stomach and side. Her ears twitch sometimes. Her taser
			dangles from just a few fingers.
		<p>
			Eventually, she mumbles, "At least this feels nice."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Seeing Vera has calmed down, Maddie begins to walk with her, bringing her down the tunnel towards the
			dilapidated station.
		<p>
			"Let's get you back to the house. You look like you need to sit down and process all of this for a moment."
		<p>
			Maddie's tail brushes against Vera's, an interesting sensation for Vera and one that Maddie hasn't felt in a
			long time, having not interacted with another catperson in years.
		<p>
			She walks back to the station with Vera, and Maddie once again leads her inside of the carriage.
		<p>
			"Do you want something to eat or drink? I don't know if I can go out and get more things with the chaos we
			caused, but I can try to get you something."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera nods, and she walks always within Maddie's reach. Vera isn't even really sure why cats have tails to
			begin with, but maybe one reason is because it assists cats in communicating nonverbally with their peers?
		<p>
			In the subway car, Vera sits down on the mattress, places her taser to her bedside, and plants her cheeks to
			her curled up fingers. It's almost an impression of ignoring her fellow cat girl, but she then follows
			through with an answer.
		<p>
			“I'm not that hungry. It's okay. Thank you for helping me back here.”
		<p>
			Although Vera did not and does not want the first-hand experience, she has today now anyway. This is life in
			a city as a different sapient species from humans.
		<p>
			“Actually, Maddie, do you happen to have a writing instrument and paper?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie stops and thinks, racking her brain trying to remember if she has anything like that.
		<p>
			"Hm. Let me check the boxes. They're full of random stuff I've collected over the years."
		<p>
			Maddie steps over to the back corner of the room, and begins digging through an impressively large pile of
			boxes. Eventually, she lets out a triumphant "Ah!" and tosses something to Vera.
		<p>
			It's a pink pen, with a weird smiley face drawn on a small sphere attached to the back of the pen.
		<p>
			"I've never actually used it. It was called a ‘Keerbo Pen’ whatever that means, I just grabbed it because I
			thought it was cute. Now let me find some paper."
		<p>
			Maddie digs around some more, eventually pulling out an entire pile of blank printing paper.
		<p>
			"Here we go, I nabbed these from an office building. I was bored and saw people using the printer, so I
			snuck in and took out all the paper as a prank. They got so confused when they had no paper in a printer
			they had just restocked!"
		<p>
			Maddie walks over to Vera and plops down the papers, seemingly satisfied with her handiwork.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera catches the pen. She squishes the pink ball of the pen between her thumb and index finger, and it
			squeaks. She shakes her head, then. As soon as the papers are at her feet, she presses one of the pages
			against the back of her busted tablet and writes furiously.
		<p>
			"Thank you, Maddie. I would say to not steal from an office, however I find on many of my assignments that
			offices have some of my most important intel. So, anyway, I'm documenting mostly what I've learned about
			your curse of becoming a catgirl, about you, and about how it's affecting me... I suppose this is how I want
			to process this, making notes, as I always do."
		<p>
			Vera writes slower, however, than when she types on her keyboard on her tablet. And she reviews her writing
			even more slowly than the writing itself. She bites her lip.
		<p>
			"What were you like before you got bit by the cat?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie stops and cocks her head, thinking back.
		<p>
			"I... don't remember much. I was pretty young, but I think I always was a bit chaotic, even before the
			curse. I got into trouble fairly often; that's actually what I was doing when I found the cat."
		<p>
			Maddie turns to the microwave, once again preparing it for use.
		<p>
			"So yeah. I don't know if the curse changed me as much as it changed you. The real reason I live alone like
			this is because... my parents kicked me out when they saw what happened to me. Thought I was a demon or
			something, they screamed at me. Threw me away. But hey, I'm better off without them now I suppose."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"The curse hasn't changed the way I behave dramatically, has it?—Other than, well, apparently making it
			harder for me to read... I suppose I'm going to stop proofreading soon. Who should care about a few typos?"
		<p>
			She groans, though, and she stops writing to address Maddie with more focus. Staring at what she wants to
			think about works better now. Vera's black hair hasn't been brushed since this all began.
		<p>
			"I'm sorry your parents rejected you after your transformation. I wonder if my own mother and father would
			have done the same. I can assure you that you're much better than a monster. The truth is that I still
			intend to help you when I'm fully human again."
		<p>
			Vera's tongue slightly peeks past her lips as she continues writing.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie looks at Vera, slightly confused.
		<p>
			"What do you mean by 'help' me? I can't exactly just become a part of society. I don't think money or
			whatever you have will solve that."
		<p>
			Maddie finishes fixing the microwave, and puts in a piece of steak from the night before. The microwave
			sparks for a moment and then hums to life.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera shrugs.
		<p>
			“If we figure out how to cure me of the curse, we'll probably figure out how to cure you too. That should
			work.”
		<p>
			The field researcher cups her chin and blinks slowly. She then shoves aside the stack of papers, and she
			lies on her stomach. Her tail wiggles behind her.
		<p>
			“Okay. That should be good for the present moment. That's not even all my recent thoughts on paper, but
			I—need a break. A break to do what exactly?”
		<p>
			Her low growl fills the railcar.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I don't know what you want a break for. Why don't you take a nap or something? Maybe you should lie down
			for a bit; it's been a pretty hectic day so far."
		<p>
			Maddie puts her steak on a plate, and moves over to the table. She begins eating, enjoying the delicious
			microwaved meal.
		<p>
			"Plus you'll look really cute napping. I'll probably nap as well, I do it pretty often. Probably a bit of a
			cat thing."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera's ears automatically register the compliment with a perk. She grabs the pillow behind her on the
			mattress and digs her nose into it, apparently content to sleep on her chest after all.
		<p>
			"Some refer to it colloquially as a 'catnap,' after all. I likely have no other choice. Even my coffee
			earlier couldn't save me from this, it seems."
		<p>
			She guides the blanket over her back, and she yawns.
		<p>
			"Maddie, I'm choosing to trust you. I think I'm still changing. Please don't let me do anything stupid. I
			need to stay focused. If you have to put me on a leash, please don't hesitate. I'm serious."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"You'll be fine. I've been cursed for over a decade and I'm okay. Don't worry, we'll get you returned to how
			you were soon enough."
		<p>
			Maddie, having finished her meal now, walks over and sits down next to Vera.
		<p>
			"Just rest now... you will need it," Maddie says in a soothing tone.
		<p>
			She gently pets Vera along her back, comforting her. It helps her fall asleep.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She nods, lazily.
		<p>
			“Okay. Thank you, Maddie.”
		<p>
			Vera, physically comforted as a cat girl, sleeps easily.
