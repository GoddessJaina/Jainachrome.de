	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			A few days later, Vera lies on her chest on the mattress and eats spoonfuls of a tub of Neapolitan ice cream
			placed on the floor. Her new hoodie hangs beside the door this time, and she's wearing the pink shirt and
			also her old uniform's white utilitarian slacks. She stretches forward and meows. She stares at Maddie and
			smirks.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie is sitting at the table, doodling in her sketchbook.
		<p>
			"Hey, save some for me. I like that stuff too, you know!"
		<p>
			Maddie gets up from the table, grabbing a spoon that's taped to the wall. She pulls it free and then begins
			to scoop down into Vera's ice cream tub.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera soon slides the ice cream away from Maddie. Her tail bobs from side to side. She prepares to dart away
			if she needs to.
		<p>
			"It's mine. You should get your own later. Which variety of ice cream is your favorite flavor? I'm guessing
			it's chocolate—it has to be."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Actually, my favorite is mint. Specifically mint with Heath. Chocolate ice cream doesn't taste like
			chocolate. It tastes like the sound of dropping a rock into a patch of grass."
		<p>
			Maddie drops into a low crouch, tail waving. Spoon at the ready, she darts her arm into the tub, digging up
			a chunk of ice cream and eating it.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“That's an odd thing to say. There's a word for describing things like that. Mint is more boring, though, so
			you would be wrong.”
		<p>
			She walks over to the microwave and leans against its tabletop, enjoying even more of the ice cream. Her
			ears perk up, however. The distant noise of a scratchy speaker resonates through the tunnels again.
		<p>
			Vera bursts out of the door.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie perks up as well, noticing the same noise. She darts after Vera, following the catgirl. She moves
			surprisingly quickly, although Maddie is just as fast.
		<p>
			"Oh, he must have come back. See, maybe there is hope!"
		<p>
			Maddie plucks the ice cream tub out of Vera's hands, eating some as they walk towards the noise.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera catches up to Reese and lies on the tunnel floor beside his speaker, turning the volume dial down
			between two of her fingernails. She's letting them grow out.
		<p>
			"Welcome back. What's the ongoing status on curing me? Have you found anything that can help? Oh, got me
			that phone?"
		<p>
			Her cat-like slits for eyes almost glow compared to the subterranean darkness. Hope...
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Reese_w">
		<p>
			He lowers his guitar and reaches into his bag. He gifts Vera an older smartphone with physical buttons by
			placing it in front of her.
		<p>
			"Really, I'm sorry I took so long. I'm not so sure why I was nervous the other day... Well, my mother's
			friend had some exciting connections to real cat people like yourselves just like I thought. One of them
			even says she knows you herself, Maddie. Which—the point I'm trying to lead up to—she wants to take you to
			dinner when you've got a chance. She says she might be able to help your friend here too, but she says she
			doesn't want to get your hopes all shot straight up. She's humble I guess."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie looks confused for a moment, and then her eyes go wide.
		<p>
			"It couldn't be her... could it? I haven't seen Irina in years. I wonder if she's okay after what happened.
			It'll be nice to see her again. Where does she want me to meet her?"
		<p>
			Maddie's tail is wagging excitedly now, with the prospect of meeting her old acquaintance and potentially a
			new lead.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Reese_w">
		<p>
			Reese hands Maddie handwriting on a tear of paper. The name of the buffet restaurant listed below the
			address, “Tan Chinese,” is familiar to her.
		<p>
			“She said she'll be there at five.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera stretches her back and hisses. She swipes the cellphone into her pocket after a button check.
		<p>
			“Sounds like she can't really help me. Perhaps I'll simply wait for Shape to respond to some messages now.
			Why should I waste my time on any more promises? Anyone else will probably just make things worse—make me a
			hamster or something. Maybe I'll wait a little longer... It's not been so bad I guess...”
		<p>
			She stands up again and leans against Maddie. This has been her way of communicating that she wants to be
			petted.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie gives Vera a loving head rub, rubbing the top of her head with one hand and her cheek and chin with
			the other.
		<p>
			"You really are getting more needy, huh. We'll be out of this mess soon enough."
		<p>
			Maddie folds up the paper and nods to Reese.
		<p>
			"Thank you so much for the help, it really means a lot. I know where this place is, I'm going to head there
			as soon as I can."
		<p>
			Maddie turns and begins leaving, gesturing for Vera to follow.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera purrs, and she closes her eyes.
		<p>
			"I don't believe I'll ever get enough of that. I suppose that makes me needy by definition."
		<p>
			She follows Maddie, bored and unimpressed with Reese's information. Her eyes glaze back to him, and she
			points a finger gun to her own head.
		<p>
			"See you later."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Reese_w">
		<p>
			"Sure. It's good to help. Anytime. I should study for AP biology before I go forget."
		<p>
			Reese packs up too. He checks his cellphone, and he warns Irina with a text message.
		<p>

	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			-------------------------
			<br>
			Maddie and Vera walk through another quiet neighborhood, looking for the restaurant. It's only three in the
			afternoon, so they still have a couple of hours to look for it.
		<p>
			"So, are you excited for this? You might finally find the cure! Isn't that great?"
		<p>
			Maddie has been bubbling with excitement, although it seems more directed at meeting up with Irina rather
			than towards curing Vera.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera's flip phone is almost pressing up to her nose, and she spams texts messages to Shape and Town about
			the curse and her efforts. Judging by the length of the messages the Field Research Department has returned
			to her, they're probably disappointed.
		<p>
			“I don't believe your ex will cure me,” She says. She shrugs.
		<p>
			“Am I paying again for our dinner?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Of course you are. I don't have any money, remember? I steal rotisserie chickens for fun, actually. Well I
			actually do find it fun but also yeah I don't have money."
		<p>
			They turn a corner, walking on similarly empty street. There's one or two people walking by who seem so
			uninterested they don't even notice the cat ears.
		<p>
			"Have you at all been looking for the restaurant? Stop looking at your phone we need to find it!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"I won't have any money either if you give it a few more weeks."
		<p>
			She points at a handful of stores they pass. She then stands by one. She snaps the clamshell phone shut.
		<p>
			"Red and yellow trim. I believe this is it? They also have one of those cheap aquariums with the coloured
			pebbles."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			A young woman standing inside the lobby of the restaurant walks out, however, immediately confirming Vera's
			guess. Irina is wearing a green qipao dress and a little shivering smile. She hugs Maddie and then takes
			them inside, and her tail sways behind her.
		<p>
			"Maddie! I'm so, so sorry it's been so long. So much happened, one thing led to another, and—right, right.
			I'll tell you. Let's eat at a booth."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie hugs her back, following her into the restaurant. Her tail is wagging now, excited to see her old
			friend. They sit at a booth, and Maddie beings speaking to her.
		<p>
			"Hi Irina! It's been so long since I saw you! How have things been going? Sorry about the cat ears. Oh by
			the way this is Vera! She's my friend who I accidentally cursed!"
		<p>
			Maddie lets out a torrent of questions and other words, nearly bouncing in her seat with excitement.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			"I'll be honest—I really didn't jive with the being turned into a neko suddenly back then. It ruined my
			whole life. For a while."
		<p>
			Irina folds her arms on the table and then lays her chin down nested inside them. Others sit in tables
			across from them and, while they keep Vera and Maddie at the edge of their vision, they'd rather eat.
		<p>
			"Then, some stuff happened—and then I found Ms. Guo! She told me my ears and tail are a blessing. She told
			me some interesting stories about that, like folklore. And she let me work here. The regulars think it's
			cute. I guess you would still say it's a curse? Still live in the subway? Sorry Vera. Hey—uh, what do you
			do?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera leans against Maddie. They're across from Irina.
		<p>
			"Nothing. Waiting for someone to fix this. Meow. My career was important work, but I can't even focus now.
			So Iet's be brief."
		<p>
			She tugs on her own ear.
		<p>
			"Can you cure me, Irina?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, when I called it a curse I meant it in the literal sense. Some scientist catgirl we found claims it
			originated from some wizard in the middle ages. So it literally is a curse! Isn't that cool?"
		<p>
			She looks at a menu, pretending to be able to read.
		<p>
			"The scientist said she's close to developing a cure but can't quite get the last step. She researched some
			old scrolls and stuff to figure out the recipe but parts are missing. So we're looking for anyone who might
			know something."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah! I can. Correction—I have something that can. I used to write some things Ms. Guo told me because I
			knew I'd forget. I close my eyes and it's just gone. I think I wrote a cure. But really, please, let's eat.
			You're starving, right?—It's a buffet."
		<p>
			She saunters to the clean plates and slides one across the laminate surface. An oily aroma rises from the
			warm metal trays of the main courses. Irina uses the tongs like wide ice cream scoops.
		<p>
			"That's pretty cool. It really is like an ancient idea. Should it pass down to children? Oh and what if, uh,
			some of us already are cursed and don't even know it?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie scoops up hot food from the buffet, piling it onto a plate as she speaks.
		<p>
			"I have no idea how it really works! I don't think a cursed person wouldn't know, with the ears and all. The
			cat parts seem to show up right after the curse is applied, from what I've seen."
		<p>
			She continues to get food, taking from pretty much everything on offer at the buffet.
		<p>
			"What do you mean about forgetting? I don't have any memory problems. Does it have to do with something
			other than the curse?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			Irina combs her long, brown hair back from her broccoli and beef smothered in MSG.
		<p>
			"Like, oh, it could be my fault—I shouldn't blame the curse."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera takes only a small portion of beef, imitation crab, and four of those miniature, cube, coffee-flavored
			cakes. She sits down before Maddie and Irina do and chews while glaring at the latter.
		<p>
			"Find me that stupid paper. Or let me talk to Ms. Guo. She's your boss?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie sits down at the booth, giving Vera a gentle slap on the shoulder.
		<p>
			"Be nice. Just because you've lost your marbles doesn't mean you can be mean to Irina."
		<p>
			Maddie turns to Irina, looking over her plate piled high with food.
		<p>
			"So, do you have the paper on hand? That'll probably make things a whole lot easier. Maybe we can go get it
			after we eat?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"I'm not being mean. I'm being firm. It'd be mean if I requested you shut up, Maddie."
		<p>
			She checks the cellphone for messages, and then she picks at a morsel of beef wedged between her teeth.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah—she's my boss. She's like my mom though! Well, my second mom—I was going to meet with Caitlyn Monday.
			Getting sidetracked sorry—Maddie's right. We can find it at my house after this. I get it, Vera, I really
			do."
		<p>
			Irina eats a lot and fast. She clumps several napkins into a greasy ball, and the ends of her hairs are
			dipped in the sauce of it all.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie happily devours her meal, not used to having so much fresh, warm food available to her. When she's
			finished, she lets out a sigh of satisfaction.
		<p>
			"Food's really good, wow. Do you do any of the cooking? I don't really know how restaurants work. They're
			hard to steal from."
		<p>
			She tosses a couple of greasy paper napkins into the ball.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			"Nope—I could never cook! The little stuff is kinda prepared from a warehouse—but those main courses? Those
			are made in-house... I wonder if you could get a job here too? That so you can buy things?"
		<p>
			Her hand glides across the table and then rests on top of Maddie's. She smiles.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera stands from the booth and plucks the remaining two cakes from her tray.
		<p>
			"Irina. Today you decided to arrive here without your notes on the cure, which must be bollocks in the first
			place, despite your information being the reason we needed you?"
		<p>
			Vera growls. She swallows one of the cakes and walks to exit.
		<p>
			"Enjoy yourselves, girls. I need more than 'hear-say.'"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Vera, get back over here right now. I get that you've gone a bit crazy but that doesn't give you the right
			to throw your manners out the window. She struggles with the same things you do. She's not just going to
			show up to work with the notes now, is she? She still has a job to do and it's much easier to just go home
			with her."
		<p>
			Maddie moves her hand to give Irina's a gentle squeeze, the two of them still not quite over each other all
			these years later.
		<p>
			"Sorry Irina. I know you're trying your best. Vera really needs this and she's just frustrated about her
			decline. Into cat insanity."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"Shut up! Let me speak."
		<p>
			The strangers seated around the restaurant murmur among themselves and try to ignore the meltdown. The bell
			chimes on the door. Vera opened it.
		<p>
			"You, then, go back home with her and grab it. Don't tell me what to do. Our struggles have so little in
			common. You understand that if she wished to be a human, and she truly had a working cure, that she would
			have cured herself by now?"
		<p>
			She flees.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			Irina pushes a fork around her plate. It's a grating noise, metal on ceramic, for their sensitive ears. She
			then pushes it all forward.
		<p>
			"Vera really isn't taking it well. You should want to consider—well, hold on. We'll fulfill her idea and go
			grab the notes. I can find and get them. It's fine. I'll, uh, pay for you and her."
		<p>
			She helps Maddie up and leads her toward where she lives further in these faded outskirts. She bites her
			nails and whispers to herself.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hey, you seem really worried. Are you alright? Vera's not usually this irritable... she's a bit grumpy, but
			not to this degree. Do you need me to help with anything?"
		<p>
			Maddie fidgets a bit nervously, feeling the need to help Irina but not sure how to do so. She follows Irina
			to her house, looking around as if Vera might appear at any moment.
		<p>
			"You seem to be doing better than I am, at least. I still have been living alone in an abandoned train. I
			suppose it isn't so bad, but it'd be nice to have a real house."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			It's a pale house in the suburbs with a trimmed lawn. She leads Maddie into the open garage and through its
			hallway, past the laundry crook, into her bedroom. A bin of dirty laundry is tipped over on the yellow
			carpet, and the first drawer she opens in her closet is overstuffed with faded, loose pieces of paper.
		<p>
			“I need help—yep. So, are you sure Vera isn't, like, going to hurt you? If no cure happens, what'll happen,
			you think?”
		<p>
			She pauses, and she rips up one of the papers.
		<p>
			“You deserve to be here too, but my brother and mother would have to agree first. I didn't say that did
			I?—they accept me being like this because I'm a part of this family. Thank my lucky stars they understand.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I don't think Vera would hurt me... not that I think she could, even if she tried. I'm much more used to my
			agility and reflexes from the curse. I think I'll be alright. I'm glad your family understands... mine
			didn't. That's why I live in a dilapidated train station."
		<p>
			Maddie pounces at some of the shreds of paper, nimbly catching them out of the air and rolling gracefully
			after landing. She steps back over to Irina, looking at the house.
		<p>
			"So, do you have it easily on hand? I would really like to get this done as soon as possible."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			Irina stops digging through the drawer to nod at Maddie. She then deposits whole bricks of paper on the
			floor and fiercely flips through those.
		<p>
			“I'm sorry, Maddie. I'll—I'll do whatever I can. Um, it's in here.”
		<p>
			She shows Maddie one of the many examples of her chicken scratch. She scans it, and she scans it again.
		<p>
			“Frog something... Legs! I remember now. She said frog legs. I'll lend you some at the restaurant—no one
			will miss 'em. Then, yeah, prove it to Vera I'm right. Or show her she's right about what she said about
			that stuff Ms. Guo told me...”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			That's an odd thing for the cure, but I guess it lines up with a curse from a wizard."
		<p>
			Maddie takes the note, and begins to head out of the house.
		<p>
			"Do you want to come with me? I don't know if you want the cure or not, if all of this works out. I
			personally won't take it; it's just a part of who I am at this point."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			Irina bites her lip and grabs Maddie's arm before she escapes too far ahead of her. She thinks of how Vera
			ran away.
		<p>
			“I, please—go come back and cure me, if it works! I guess I must have didn't think it'd work when she told
			me frog legs. I was right… She missed stuff that your scientist probably isn't. I miss being human. I—I'll
			work there forever if it doesn't work.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie takes one of Irina's hands in her own, and stares into her eyes.
		<p>
			"I swear I'll come back and bring you the cure. I caused this mess and I should fix it. I'll go get the frog
			legs and bring them to the scientist."
		<p>
			She pauses for a moment and then pulls Irina into a hug, giving her a kiss on the cheek.
		<p>
			"I'm sorry nothing ever worked out. I promise I'll fix this."
		<p>
			She heads for the restaurant, seemingly more serious than she's ever been in her life.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Irina_w">
		<p>
			She nods and wipes some sparse tears away. The stress caught up to Irina.
		<p>
			“Thank you.”
