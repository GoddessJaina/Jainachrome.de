	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			She wakes up to find Maddie curled up next to her, still sleeping, in a way that Vera finds extremely
			adorable. Sunlight is pouring through the scratched windows of the train car as they've slept late into the
			morning.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera doesn't intend to wake Maddie up prematurely, as unexpectedly pleased with the cute, physical company
			as she is. So, Vera reaches for the stack of papers beside them, intending to write some more notes down
			before she probably loses interest and doodles or something. Bloody curse.
		<p>
			She discovers immediately that she can't read what she wrote last time, however. It's clearly language, but
			it might as well be Indonesian. She yelps and kicks Maddie on her leg once, waking her up after all.
		<p>
			“Maddie, we need to get out of here immediately. I can't—read anymore!?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie awakens abruptly, jumping straight up out of the box, her tail completely straight in surprise.
		<p>
			"AAAA! What happened? Are you okay? Why did you kick me?!"
		<p>
			Maddie shouts out a string of questions, clearly alarmed by the sudden awakening. Then, she calms down after
			a moment.
		<p>
			"You can't just smack me to wake me up like that. It's really rude! And what's this about reading? If you're
			asking me to read, I can't do that! I don't know how to do that. Do it yourself or something!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She throws the papers in the air between the box and Maddie, and so the pages fly with different velocities
			and then scatter the carpet.
		<p>
			“Allow me clarify. Your curse has made me unlearn how to read, Maddie.” She growls. “So, all these notes are
			gibberish to me now, too. We're going, now.”
		<p>
			She shakes her head, stands from the box, and then she scurries out the door. She throws the hoodie over her
			ears, and she stares back into the train-car, expectant.
		<p>
			“I feel so stupid. Just take me to the outskirts you talked about yesterday.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie follows her out the door, hastily getting dressed the way she has.
		<p>
			"We can get to the outskirts through back allies and stuff. It's like a half hour walk."
		<p>
			She walks over to a hole in the wall, going through it and climbing over a rusty chain fence.
		<p>
			"C'mon, it's this way!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera stops at the chain fence, studies the dim scene, and then climbs the fence after all. She approaches
			Maddie's side, and she keeps her chin low.
		<p>
			“I have—mixed opinions about last night. I can't believe how easily I slept after you joined me in the
			cardboard box. It's like I was cold and lonely.” She almost chuckles. “Is that a sensation you feel
			sometimes, sleeping there?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yes. Quite often, actually. I don't really get to hang out with anyone other than the occasional local kid.
			It gets pretty lonely."
		<p>
			Maddie walks behind an old bookstore, through an alleyway. This part of the city is mostly old buildings,
			few reaching more than a few floors tall.
		<p>
			"This part of town is quite nice. I like just hanging out on a rooftop here. Not as loud and busy as
			everywhere else. We should keep going, though. Maybe we'll find something helpful soon."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Sorry,” She says. “It's possible I understand now. Furthermore, I quite dislike children.”
		<p>
			The noise even here is everywhere to her sensitive ears, but it really is much less. Maddie's behaviors are
			really all starting to make sense, even the casual insistence to climb a building to its roof. Even her
			erratic nature.
		<p>
			She swallows, and she continues her confession. “I'm bored. I almost would rather be sleeping. That's kind
			of scary, isn’t it?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Wasn't the whole point of this to find you some help? Why are you trying to nap? I like myself a nap
			sometimes but definitely not now. Let's keep moving, there has to be someone or something that can help us!"
		<p>
			Maddie continues to lead Vera down alleyways and quiet streets until she reaches an old abandoned power
			plant next to a canal.
		<p>
			"Hey, if we're looking for other cat people, maybe that's a good spot. Abandoned buildings are easy to move
			into, as you saw with my home."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Okay, yeah, you're right. Maybe cat people will be in that run-down place. It's possible.”
		<p>
			She sounds less than confident, anyway. She grabs an empty styrofoam cup from a dirty table and tosses it
			back and forth between her hands with rather good reflexes. She then tosses it at Maddie. “Catch.”
		<p>
			She sticks her tongue out slightly.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			The cup misses completely, but Maddie is unfazed and immediately pounces after it with surprisingly agility.
			She grabs it and then tumbles while clutching onto it. She then brings it back to Vera, smiling.
		<p>
			"Okay, back to what we were doing please. You're cute but I want to get this situation fixed."
		<p>
			Maddie climbs over the fence and then walks over to the boarded up entrance of the power plant. One of the
			windows of the building, however, is conspicuously not boarded up. Maddie spots this window and climbs up to
			it, which is about 20 feet off the ground. She climbs through it, tumbling onto a metal catwalk below it.
			She moves to the window and then looks down at Vera.
		<p>
			"Come on up, let's look around. You can climb up here easily, right?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She smirks, too, bearing her fangs. “Well, thank you. Okay, sure, we're getting me back to normal, right.”
		<p>
			Vera climbs over this next fence without so much as stopping, and she then runs a nail on the rough material
			of the sheer wall. She tilts her head back and forth, and her tail waves behind her.
		<p>
			“I can totally do it this time, but can you come back down first? You know, in case I fall down so you can
			catch me? I believe they say 'safety first'!”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie rolls her eyes and then without warning jumps out the third floor window, landing on her feet
			seemingly unharmed.
		<p>
			"Okay weak little kitty who can't climb on her own. Go ahead. I'll definitely catch you if you fall."
		<p>
			Maddie gives Vera a grin, waiting for her to begin climbing.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera screams. The harmless landing, though, leads her to stop and fold her arms. She then emphasizes a growl
			and starts scaling the wall as if it were rock climbing with many thin, unintended handholds and footholds.
			It's almost as natural of a 'sense' as the night vision.
		<p>
			“I'm not a 'weak little kitty'. I'd like to remind you that I'm essentially an agent. This curse complements
			my training while I have it. Where's your training?”
		<p>
			She passes through the window frame, and she continues, “At the bare minimum, you could have told me I can
			land on my two feet like a real cat can land on four unharmed.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"The two feet thing actually took a lot of practice. I landed on all fours for years, but finally managed to
			start doing it on two. And my training was successfully shoplifting for years without getting caught and
			shipped to a lab or something."
		<p>
			Maddie gracefully climbs back up the wall, much faster than Vera did. She stands next to her and surveys the
			interior. There are multiple turbines, which would have spun using a water wheel in the canal when the power
			plant was in use. There's also a metal door on the opposite side of the building leading into what is
			labeled as a control room. Scratched and fogged up windows make it difficult to see into the control room,
			however.
		<p>
			"Let's go check the control room. Maybe someone's in there or we'll find something cool and breakable. I'm
			kinda bored."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Speaking of laboratories, my society has a state-of-the-art facility that would probably love to conduct
			some trials on you,” She says. She puts her hands on her hips, already walking to the control room.
		<p>
			“We won't hurt you, and we can reimburse you. You should consider it. Except... We are trying to cure me
			soon, in case this is like a time-limited cure or something, of course. It would have to wait, if you
			volunteered. Anyway, I'm bored too. I even instructed you that this was boring earlier. Told you so. First
			breakable thing is mine.”
		<p>
			They make it to the door, and she struggles with the metal handle. It's heavy and locked. She meows and
			steps aside.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie rattles the lock a bit, and then her ears perk up as she has an idea. She pulls out a set of lock
			picking tools and then begins to work on the lock. Her tongue pokes out slightly as she's concentrating,
			poking expertly inside the lock. A few minutes later, it clicks open, and Maddie gives Vera an over-the-top
			bow.
		<p>
			"After you. You're welcome."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Do you always have a lock picking set with you?”
		<p>
			She shakes her head, her ears suggesting she's still rather amused, and pulls the handle again. Then, a cat
			with black fur immediately darts out of the room. So, Vera glances at Maddie with hope, drags her into the
			room with her, and closes the door behind them.
		<p>
			It's a large control room. Countless levers and buttons are deactivated, judging by the sea of scruffy cats
			squirming all across the panels. And a tall woman with cat ears and an especially large and fluffy tail
			turns around to face Maddie and Vera from her office chair beside a desk with a yellowing computer.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Caroline_w">
		<p>
			"Oh my goodness you let Johnifer escape. Wait... how did you even get in here? I thought the door was
			locked."
		<p>
			She adjusts her circular glasses, looking at the two women who entered.
		<p>
			"Hold on. You two have the curse too! Is that why you're here? I'm doing important research right now, you
			know."
		<p>
			One of the cats climbs up onto the keyboard where she was working and she shouts a name, picking up the cat
			and setting it down on the floor.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera nods. She scurries to the monitor the stranger is working at only to be reminded that she can't make
			any sense of the text, and she leans on some nearby equipment.
		<p>
			"Yes. We're here to cure me of the curse. Will you be able to help me? What's your name? Please, I really
			can't go on like this. I'm worried I'll be stuck like this forever. Mrow..."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Caroline_w">
		<p>
			"My name is Caroline. I got bitten by one of these cats—" She glares at one of the cats in particular. "—and
			got this affliction a few years ago. Much like you two have. I've been researching it and looking for a
			cure. What are your names? I could use some help, and it'll be mutually beneficial if you want to be cured
			as well."
		<p>
			She turns back to her computer, looking through some files.
		<p>
			"I think I'm close to getting it, but I'm not certain. I think I'm still missing something; my prototype
			cures seem to purge the mind for a few minutes, but it reverts quickly after, and the physical changes won't
			go away."
