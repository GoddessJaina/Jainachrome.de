    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        Vera sits at her white desk in her private quarters, scrolling down the Town's structured newsletter for the
        week on her vertical monitor. Vera's adjusted report concerning her last assignment is at the top and has been
        provided by Town's editorial group the headline "Maddie's Curse."
      </p>

      <p>
        She bites again into her cold cut sandwich. Her doorbell rings multiple times in quick succession, and Vera is
        quick to open the door before it proceeds any longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hey, Maddie. Have you been still enjoying your stay? Do you have any more questions for me than last time?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Oh yeah, it's been great. I've been loving my stay so far! Don't ask why people keep entering my suite as
        humans and leaving as catpeople, okay? Especially the cute ones."
      </p>

      <p>
        Maddie is wearing a pair of new jeans and a hoodie with the Town logo on it; a major improvement over her old,
        worn clothes. She still has her old red scarf, although it's been freshly washed.
      </p>

      <p>
        "So how do I power my microwave here? I've been eating the breakfast sandwiches cold and it's really hard to
        chew on them."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>"You're transforming people willingly?"</p>

      <p>Vera sighs. She steps outside into the long, pearly corridor, and the door auto-locks.</p>

      <p>
        "I hope our Culinary Department was approved for an additional order of frog legs. I unfortunately can believe
        that the residents here are bored enough that they would prefer to alter their physiology for their own quick
        amusement... Have they been treating you appropriately in Scientific Research?"
      </p>

      <p>She pinches the bridge of her nose.</p>

      <p>"Maddie, you're intended to press the power button. Does your microwave not function correctly?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Well... I'm just worried about the wiring is all. I almost caught fire when I messed up the wiring of my old
        microwave, and I don't trust the way they've set it up here. It just disappears into the wall? What happens to
        the batteries?"
      </p>

      <p>Maddie looks a window admiring the rolling waves of the ocean below.</p>

      <p>
        "Yeah, they've been treating me okay. Taking a lot of pictures, couple of samples of my fur, and I even had one
        of the researches volunteer to collect some of my "fluids" for "research purposes" after the testing. She's a
        cutie. I like it here."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        "Nothing. Nothing happens to the batteries, Maddie. You should consider applying for some of the freely
        available courses offered through Town's Education Department."
      </p>

      <p>She steps beside Maddie and rubs her eyes.</p>

      <p>
        "Thank you for volunteering. I've just been awaiting my next assignment, meanwhile. Unfortunately, however, my
        clinician ordered to my department that I be held here at least another week."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Well, you do act a bit crazy. I also really don't think 'clinician' is a word. Crazy world we live in where I'm
        the more rational and reasonable person between the two of us, huh?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Maddie reaches into a bag she's been carrying and pulls out a chicken drumstick, which she begins to eat with no
        regard for the fact that she's in the middle of a spotless hallway.
      </p>

      <p>"Oh yeah I got this from one of the eateries here. Want some?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        "How do I 'act crazy?' And clinician is a word. I'm certainly more rational than you. I was already eating
        something in my room, but thank you."
      </p>

      <p>
        She takes her tablet from her sash and taps on it for several seconds like a metronome. She stares at a page she
        made earlier today, and she tilts her head.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Am I behaving strangely? Is there an example you would point to? It's possible that I'm not aware of what
        you're speaking on and it may be a lingering effect of having been a cat and human hybrid for weeks..."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Well, I don't see how you could possibly sit in a desk like that all day. Isn't it pretty normal to get the
        urge to sprint around in circles after more than like 10 minutes of sitting down?"
      </p>

      <p>Maddie finishes her drumstick and then expertly tosses it into a wastebasket on the other side of the hall.</p>

      <p>"I'm just teasing you. This is probably how you acted before I bit you. Are you busy today?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        "Truthfully, I don't enjoy sitting at my desk. That's one reason I want to attend to my next assignment already.
        I just feel stifled otherwise."
      </p>

      <p>She types something small and shakes her head.</p>

      <p>
        "No, I have nothing scheduled. I also confirmed with Town AI that it's unlikely I will be placed for an
        emergency assignment these next few days. Perhaps I'll skim through some old notes for revision. Maybe I'll just
        sleep."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>"Who's town AI? Are they cute?"</p>

      <p>Maddie seems genuinely curious, and it appears that she doesn't know what 'AI' means.</p>

      <p>
        "I feel like there's nothing to do around here. Like they just give me the food; I don't need to steal it or
        anything. Feels too easy, I guess."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        "No—it's a groundbreaking supercomputer that also demonstrates some characteristics of human-like thinking. You
        can speak with it on any monitor here. I'm not sure it likes me... Have you attended the Entertainment District
        yet? You may enjoy the Virtual Reality Pavilion or the dance club. You could join a recreational club, perhaps.
        I understand you wouldn't enjoy our library yet."
      </p>

      <p>She hardly can mention this branch of Town's layout without yawning.</p>

      <p>"Additionally, you could volunteer for a job."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>Maddie turns to a monitor in the corner of the hallway, and shouts at it.</p>

      <p>"Hey Town AI! Are you cute? Vera says you aren't! Also where's the entertainment district, I'm bored!"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>Vera's tablet beeps with a two-tone notification. She sighs.</p>

      <p>
        "It says that it's up to your discretion but that many have claimed it is. It also says the district is up the
        elevator and then 'where the tallest buildings of Town are located.' I suppose it knows you wouldn't read the
        sidewalk signs. Enjoy yourself, Maddie."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Did you still want to see that movie, by the way? We can go down to the entertainment district together! It'll
        be fun!"
      </p>

      <p>Maddie grabs Vera by the sleeve and starts practically dragging her along with her.</p>

      <p>
        "You get to pick the movie I trust your judgement. You know, I never get to watch any movies. It's too hard to
        sneak into a theater and I don't have a phone. Does Town provide phones?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>"I never go there, Maddie—okay, could you please let go of me? Maddie?"</p>

      <p>
        She groans and pulls back on the excited catgirl, but she fails to hold her ground despite her training.
        Eventually, she concedes and walks with her. She was leaning towards sleeping otherwise, anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I was in an altered state when I promised to watch a movie with you; however, I suppose I could maintain my
        promise anyway. Especially if it means you will stop grabbing me like that. We can also get you a Town-issued
        phone on the way to the theater..."
      </p>

      <p>They take the elevator and then walk toward Town's perimeter of services.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>--------------------</p>

      <p>They arrive at the Entertainment District, where Maddie is still dragging Vera around.</p>

      <p>"Where's the theater? I can't read the signs so you're going to have to point it out to me."</p>

      <p>
        She stops at a vending machine that has absolutely no cost for any of its snacks; a luxury that Town residents
        enjoy. Despite this, she still opens a panel on the side and fiddles with some wires, causing four bags of chips
        to drop out. She snatches them up and opens one and starts munching.
      </p>

      <p>"Want some? I love looting vending machines like that. So much fun watching them all drop out of the box!"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        Some of Town's passing pedestrians take notice of the vandalism and refer on their personal devices for security
        services, although it's only met with one electrician being scheduled for the machine in thirty minutes. Others
        wave at Maddie excitedly, including one of the scientists she transformed into a catgirl. Vera, of course,
        presses her fingers into her forehead.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I suspect your skills would be better used elsewhere. Please don't get yourself in trouble with our
        authorities, okay? The theater is this building."
      </p>

      <p>
        She takes one of the bags from the vending machine open compartment and then walks toward a particularly boxy
        building with white flare lights lining the entrance stairway. The lobby is dim and with a deep red carpet, a
        surprisingly familiar appearance in this futuristic society, and Vera pans down a monitor's page on the wall.
      </p>

      <p>"A private showing would allow us to choose almost any film we want."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>"Oohh how romantic with just the two of us!"</p>

      <p>Maddie gives Vera a shit-eating grin and looks at the panel intently as if she can read the movie titles.</p>

      <p>"Just pick one that sounds neat I don't care really."</p>

      <p>Maddie wanders around the lobby and then waves at a researcher passing by the glass doors of the building.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        "You're ridiculous. Okay, this feature titled 'Steel Vendetta' is rated highly by oversea critics and our own
        critics. Perhaps you like swords."
      </p>

      <p>
        She chooses it without further prompt from Maddie, though, and leads her into one of the several rooms further
        inside with a green indicator light over the entrance. When the door closes behind them, it locks, of course.
        She confirms the movie to begin on a small panel and then sits with Maddie in the second-to-front row. And Vera
        reclines the back of her seat.
      </p>

      <p>"I'm surprised you wanted to do this activity with me," She admits suddenly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Well, I'm bored and wanted something to do. I also kind of wanted to get to know you a little better because
        you weren't really yourself for most of the time I've known you."
      </p>

      <p>She opens another bag of chip, offering a couple to Vera.</p>

      <p>"I bet we'll finish all of these before the movie even starts!"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        Vera takes from Maddie's offering of chips and nods. The ambient light of the room dims to twilight, and the
        film then frames a thundering rainstorm over an Eastern village.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I think I understand. I wanted something to do today too, potentially. Hopefully this is entertaining, then?"
      </p>

      <p>
        She places three fingers and her thumb on her cheek, and her focus narrows onto the sword in the center of the
        next shot. Its wielder is a bruised silhouette in the dark, some stoic man.
      </p>

      <p>"What would you wish to learn about me?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "Hm. About you... well, I'm actually kind of curious how long you've been in Town. Some of the people I've met
        here have been here their whole lives. Have you?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Maddie watches the film as the sword cleaves down in a dramatic shot, cutting at another man. Seemingly nothing
        happens for a moment, and then the man collapses to one knee and then falls down dead.
      </p>

      <p>"Oh damn that guy got owned. Pretty neat movie!"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        "I was born here, yes. My mother and father, however, originated from the United Kingdom. They also moved away
        from here a long time ago."
      </p>

      <p>
        She pauses, allowing a bystander in the movie to cry out from fear and awe. She touches her own shoulder and
        grimaces, watching the blood ooze from the corpse.
      </p>

      <p>"I like it too."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>Maddie crunches on her snacks happily, not taking notice of Vera's reaction to the visceral scene.</p>

      <p>
        "You know, I don't actually think I've ever seen someone die in the city. I've seen car accidents and even
        stabbings ay night but everyone always walked away. Movies are weird."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        Vera often considers movies as a form of cheap escapism. Instead of tackling the real world, someone could
        instead lounge in a lonely room and drain two hours on something they wouldn't remember next year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than explaining that, though, she says, "I also haven't witnessed anyone die in front of me, Maddie. I'm
        ordered to conceal carry a pistol on some assignments, however, for my self-defense. Town AI seems to believe I
        will need it sometime."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>"Woah. Did you have it when you went on the assignment to find me? That's kind of menacing."</p>

      <p>
        Maddie continues the movie, where the man from earlier stands on a swaying rope bridge over a foggy cavern. A
        band of soldiers are chasing him, lining up one at a time. It's rather comedic for such a serious movie.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>"I didn't."</p>

      <p>
        She wouldn't have taken the shot, anyway. The swordsman is impossible to approach, even in these close quarters.
        The bodies slip off the bridge with the fluency of each swipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Please, however, don't be concerned. My training to be a field researcher was designed to keep everyone safe. I
        will be fine."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>
        The movie ends with the swordsman at the peak of a mountain, dueling against his brother in a bittersweet clash
        of blades and ideals.
      </p>

      <p>"Neat movie. Movies are neat. We should do this again sometime!"</p>

      <p>Maddie stands up, stretching after two hours of sitting.</p>

      <p>"I don't think I've sat still like that for hours like that in years. Apart from sleeping of course."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>The lights dial back on. Vera picks up their discarded bags of chips.</p>

      <p>
        "I suppose we could watch movies again later. I would imagine more days like this will arrive after my next
        assignments."
      </p>

      <p>
        She walks with Maddie out of the building. Sunlight still reaches through the glass dome, and the vending
        machine Maddie tampered earlier dispenses a nougat bar for a child with yellow hair.
      </p>

      <p>--------------------</p>

      <p>
        A banner reaches from one corner of the ceiling to another with the pastel-colored proclamation, "All Catboys,
        Catgirls, etc Welcome!"
      </p>

      <p>Vera rubs the ridge of her forehead and scoffs.</p>

      <p>"Who made this, Maddie? It's not particularly politically correct."</p>

      <p>
        Fifteen Town residents consisting of primarily young adults chat and purr around the room. Lunda from the
        Education Department is toying with a ball of yarn. Vera Hanley is the only one who isn't a cat person. She
        drinks from a complementary glass of seltzer water.
      </p>

      <p>"Congratulations on securing public interest for your recreational club."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>"What does 'politically correct' even mean? It's the catpeople club, of course it's for catpeople."</p>

      <p>
        She pounces at a bottle someone throws her way, rolling and quickly jumping to her feet before popping it open
        and sipping. She strides over to a catboy with purple hair, probably around her age. He's quite feminine,
        wearing a skirt and striped thigh-highs.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hey Sen! Great work with the banners. Vera had issues with it which means it probably is perfect! How's the
        party been so far?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Sen_w">
      <p>Sen smiles and looks up at the banner.</p>

      <p>
        "Yeah I had to ask one of the enbies how to go about inclusivity on the sign or whatever and they said the 'etc'
        was fine. Glad you like it, stayed up 'til 3 AM making it. Hi Vera, honestly surprised to see you here
        considering what happened. Not interested in round two, are you?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>"Sen, your circadian rhythm may be suffering with that sleep schedule."</p>

      <p>She rolls her eyes.</p>

      <p>
        "No, no round two. Maddie simply insisted that I make an appearance for the first meeting, and I do suppose I'm
        a component of why this club even exists at all. Maybe I'll have interesting notes to make from today. Oh—Lucy,
        not you too."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Lucy_w">
      <p>
        Lucy smirks and waves at everyone as she enters the communal space although many are too distracted to
        reciprocate. She's in a sportier getup today: white sneakers, shorts, and short-sleeves. And she's boasting cat
        features of her own. Her cat ears have some fuzz blending to her genetically-engineered light blue hair color,
        her tail is also this blue, and her earrings are cat bells so small that they barely sound when they ring.
      </p>

      <p>She sits nearby Maddie and Sen with her legs fanned.</p>

      <p>
        "Hi, Vera. I had to try it, don't act like that. Maddie's a sweetheart, so that helps. So, how do I look? The
        ears JUST came in. Do they look kind of small to anyone else? I like how Sen's turned out, wow."
      </p>

      <p>She licks her wrist.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>Maddie pats Lucy on top of the head, right between the ears.</p>

      <p>
        "Nah, your ears are adorable! Just the right size. Your earrings are super cute by the way. I never got to wear
        earrings much, actually. Jewelry stores are kind of high security."
      </p>

      <p>Maddie chugs her drink, then chucks the bottle across the room so it bounces off the wall and into a bin.</p>

      <p>"I'm glad you and Sen are enjoying this, hehe. I can't say I don't enjoy biting people from time to time."</p>

      <p>She leans against Sen and snuggles against him a bit, giving him a knowing smile.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Lucy_w">
      <p>
        "You're so sweet, god. Thank you Maddie! You could borrow some of mine sometime, if you want? I seriously can't
        believe you lived all alone like that for so long, speaking of that."
      </p>

      <p>She plants her chin on her knuckles, and she faces Vera and raises her eyebrows.</p>

      <p>"I honestly was starting to think this lady didn't have a heart."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>
        The comment startles Vera from her encroaching boredom. She finishes her cup, and some of the fizzy water
        drizzles from her lip.
      </p>

      <p>
        "What?—Of course I have a heart. For what reasoning did you believe I chose to work in the Field Research
        Department?"
      </p>

    <div class="wrap Lucy_w">
      <p>"Wasn't it because you were bored here?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
      <p>Maddie chimes in, clearly enjoying the way that Lucy is bothering Vera.</p>

      <p>
        "I think she did it so she could meet cute catgirls. That was why you let me bite you, right? You think I'm cute
        don't you. Come to think of it... want me to bite you again? It would be realllyyy funny to see you like that
        again. I think my favorite part of the curse was when you forgot how to read."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Sen_w">
      <p>Sen gives Maddie a confused look.</p>

      <p>
        "Wait, Vera forgot how to read when she got cursed? I haven't had any issues with that at all. Been able to get
        plenty of work done despite the urge to nap, actually. Pretty good so far."
      </p>

      <p>Sure enough, there's no typos or anything on the banner Sen made recently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>She covers her face with her hand and groans.</p>

      <p>"She's absurd, isn't she? No, Maddie, I did not permit you to do anything. You essentially ambushed me!"</p>

      <p>
        A smile sneaks past her fingers, however, that catgirl's limitless absurdity chipping away at her day-to-day
        composure after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The Scientific Research Department has been discovering odd psychological results on some of the participants
        to your curse. I had no control over my own symptoms... Anyway, you'd need a much better reason than it being
        funny to expect me to agree to that on my own accord."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Lucy_w">
      <p>Lucy stands up and scratches behind Maddie's right ear.</p>

      <p>
        She whispers, "Hey, I owe you big time if you go bite her right now again. I literally have to see Vera like
        that."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Sen_w">
      <p>
        Sen looks at Maddie, then at Vera and then back to Maddie, who has dropped into a low crouch. Seeing the
        mischievous glint in her eyes, he starts to step forward.
      </p>

      <p>"Wait, Maddie, sto-"</p>

      <p>
        He is cut off by the catgirl pouncing at Vera, so fast she's just a blur as she knocks the other woman to the
        ground.
      </p>

      <p>"-p that... she doesn't seem to want round two... oh, how can I stop you. How could anyone stop you?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Vera_w">
      <p>Vera yelps on impact and then swears. Not again.</p>
