	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera sighs as she examines the sprawling subway map on the brick wall. She pushes down on her blue crescent
			moon hair clip in her black hair.
		<p>
			Vera realizes that she loves driving. A rental vehicle gives her broad choice for direction, freedom of
			speed, and utter privacy. A subway train, on the other hand, is stuffy. It's like waiting in one of Town's
			submarine pods, waiting to arrive at a port, but with all the quality of life of a can of sardines.
		<p>
			She sighs, skims again her assignment briefing notes on her Town-issued tablet, and boards the gray line.
			It's better for the environment, anyway, and the roads in this city are gummed up.
		<p>
			Some minutes later, she walks out behind a small mob of passengers and then walks into a quiet, deserted
			stretch of the subway tunnels.
		<p>
			The cat-girl lived somewhere here, somehow.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			Alone, in a dimly lit section of the tunnels, it is silent apart from the distant sound of subway cars
			moving along other tunnels. However, from around a bend down the tracks, a faint sound echoes. A small,
			shiny object, about the size of a coin, catches on the light from the electric lamps lining the walls of the
			tunnel. It rolls to a stop, falling flat on the ground just in front of the bend in the tunnel.
		<p>
			Then, it is once again quiet, with only the low hum of the lamps to keep Vera company.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			The field researcher walks along the decommissioned rail after the faint flash of the coin, watching her
			back every dozen steps. As usual, she's trespassing. The potential lead, however, is too great to pass.
		<p>
			As she approaches the bend, Vera reaches into her white sash over her white, dressy shirt and primes the
			trigger to her taser. She inhales sharply, leaning on the tunnel wall, and she then snaps herself around the
			corner.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The stretch of tunnel around the bend is equally deserted. One object catches her eye, however: a metal
			panel with slats on it, quickly recognizable as the cover for a vent. It matches the fairly large vents
			spaced out in intervals throughout the subway system, which are placed several feet off the ground.
		<p>
			Past the fallen panel, a sparse trail of similar coins leads into the darkness. Being decommissioned, the
			city doesn't bother to keep the lighting on this far from the active tracks.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			The field researcher stares into the deep of the tunnel, and she shivers. She removes her tablet and her
			taser from her sash, one into each hand, and she shines her tablet's flashlight feature into the expanse to
			little effect. Still, she presses forward along the trail of coins. She's not afraid of the dark.
	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			Finally, reaching the end of the trail of coins, Vera finds a vent missing its cover. The choking darkness
			of the tunnel does not relent to her flashlight, and it is similarly dark peering down the vent.
		<p>
			Then Vera hears the faint scuffle of a shoe on concrete behind her, and a mere moment later, feels a hand
			wrap around her wrist, firmly stopping her from aiming her taser.
		<p>
			"Hehe. You really weren't very hard to catch, you literally fell for a trail of shiny objects."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Her wrist struggles with a strength that should come as surprising to the stranger. She steps around in a
			tight circle, and she searches for a face in this void.
		<p>
			“Let me go. Let me go right now! Who are you?”
		<p>
			She then flicks her tablet flashlight in the direction of the arm. She frowns at what she sees, and she says
			with her more standard deliberation, “I won't hurt you. I've come here simply to meet you. I knew those
			coins would lead to something...”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			She feels the grip on her wrist tighten in response to her struggling as sharp nails dig into her skin.
		<p>
			As the light flashes onto the face of her aggressor, she sees a dark haired young woman wearing a red
			bandana peering back at her, although her attention is quickly drawn to the two cat ears atop her head. This
			was definitely the person she was looking for.
		<p>
			"Hmm... I'd love to chat! Although I think you should drop the taser, you probably won't be needing it."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera is fascinated, too, by the cat-like eyes of the woman. Magical beings such as this one would always
			seem to come up in her routine assignments. Maybe she has an advantage in the form of night vision?
		<p>
			"That taser is merely for self-defense. What's your name?"
		<p>
			She stares at the cat girl blankly, and sometimes anxiously. And eventually she concedes to letting go of
			the taser, letting it clack against a metal beam. A blue spark, in that moment, bridges from the tip of the
			weapon into the metal beam.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Me? I'm Maddie! Nice to meet you, office lady. Do you have a name too?"
		<p>
			Then, distracted by the taser arcing blue electricity across the pipe, Maddie looks down with wide eyes.
		<p>
			"That taser looks really fun, you should let me play around with it sometime!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“I'm Vera. I'm not an office lady; I'm a field researcher.”
		<p>
			She sighs, and she shakes her head. “Please, let go of me, Maddie. And let's go somewhere else. I can't see
			anything. Why are you here, anyway?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Meh. I was bored and wanted to hang out in the tunnels a bit. I like watching the trains go by. Then I saw
			your prowling around and thought it'd be funny to lure you in."
		<p>
			Maddie cocks her head and looks at Vera quizzically.
		<p>
			"Why are you in the subway system looking for a catgirl if you're a 'field researcher’? Aren't you supposed
			to be in the countryside researching fields?"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“Well, thank you for catching my attention.”
		<p>
			She rolls her eyes. She then tries to walk with Maddie, blindly, dismissing her taser. She could get it
			later.
		<p>
			“I understand that you're not interested in letting go of me? Okay. Let us out of here. And please, a 'field
			researcher' where I'm from refers to an agent that is sent out on assignments for information gathering,
			especially through extensive investigations. You've been—causing interest in this city.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie, realizing that Vera probably isn't trying to do anything to harm her at this point, lets go of
			Vera's arm. Beginning to walk further into the tunnel, Maddie gestures for Vera to follow.
		<p>
			"Ehehehe. I'm glad to hear people are enjoying my mischief. It's quite fun, you should really try it
			sometime! Yeah, I can lead us out of here. But not the way you came; let's walk in the dark for a bit. It'll
			be fun!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera sidesteps from Maddie with this opportunity, creating space. She stops to glance back at her taser
			nearby, but she shakes her head and continues on with her.
		<p>
			“I'm more interested in protocol, Maddie, if I can help it. I'll follow you in the dark, though, okay.”
		<p>
			Vera clutches her tablet against her shirt, and she bites her lip.
		<p>
			“Why do you conduct 'mischief', if I may inquire? Is it really just for fun? I'm not sure, for example,
			stealing should fall under that umbrella.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Why? 'Cause it's fun. And there's not much else for me to do. What am I supposed to do, sit at a desk for 8
			hours a day until I die? I'd much rather do whatever I want. Also, what you would call 'stealing', I would
			call 'liberating food trapped in the Flormart.' If the food didn't want me to have it, then why is it so
			easy to grab?"
		<p>
			Maddie chuckles, continuing to walk down the tunnel. There's no sign of another end, only pitch darkness.
			Although Maddie seems perfectly fine walking with no light as Vera follows along with her tablet's
			flashlight.
		<p>
			"But you wouldn't understand. You wouldn't get the joys of tomfoolery unless you tried it."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“There's a difference between individual freedom and repeating minor crime. Fortunately, I'm willing to help
			you understand the difference.”
		<p>
			The image of typing into her notes “finds committing petty crime entertaining” dissatisfies Vera. Town had
			the understanding this catgirl likely had some greater motive and, in any case, wanted Vera to get to the
			source. She could perhaps guide Maddie away from repeating her 'misbehavior'?
		<p>
			“Let me present you a hypothetical. Suppose you own a small business, and suppose I'm a customer in your
			small business. If I confiscated your merchandise and claimed something like, 'they seemed lonely,' how
			would you feel?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Owning a small business sounds really boring, I don't think I would do that. Instead, let me ask you this:
			How would you feel if you were hungry and saw a really tasty looking rotisserie chicken? Why should you have
			to stay hungry? Just eat it, you need the food to keep living after all."
		<p>
			Maddie pulls out a bag of chips and begins crunching on them as she continues walking.
		<p>
			"Not like I have money to buy it anyways. I can't believe you want me to starve already, we just met!"
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			“I don't want you to starve, Maddie. I'm humane. Furthermore, I'm sorry you don't have money.”
		<p>
			The sound of the munching is accompanied by Vera then tapping her tablet screen for her notes application.
			Vera wishes economic disparity wasn't, in her exploration, such a huge watermark of the world's culture and
			issues.
		<p>
			“Okay. Maddie, tell me about your background. In what kind of community were you raised? What are your other
			day-to-day tasks today?”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Wow. You really ask a lot of questions; I purposefully cause trouble and I'm somehow less annoying than you
			are. Sure, here's the short of it. I don't really remember much of my parents. That was a long time ago. I
			do remember wandering off one day and finding a stray cat. I tried to pet it, and it bit me. It kinda hurt
			but I was fine."
		<p>
			Maddie stops dead in her tracks, and spins around to face Vera. She flashes a big grin, her fangs visible in
			the light from Vera's tablet. She then begins stepping towards Vera.
		<p>
			"You know, I guess I could show you what happened. I think it'll be helpful for your 'document' or whatever
			you're writing about me."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She rubs her forehead.
		<p>
			“I get called annoying often. Anyway... That's unfortunate. Why are you—looking at me like that? Maddie?”
		<p>
			Vera steps backwards as Maddie approaches her, and then she flashes panic as she thumbs through her device
			for the emergency notification service.
		<p>
			“Show me what? W-What does a stray cat have to do with anything? What are you doing?”
		<p>
			Vera suddenly bolts in a wide arch around the catgirl.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Try as Vera might, Maddie, unsurprisingly, has the reflexes of a cat. She pounces directly at the other
			woman, knocking her to the ground. As Vera had been attempting to arc around Maddie, she had been between
			Maddie and the pit where the tracks are. As the catgirl collides with her, they both fall down into the pit,
			the tablet falling to the ground with the camera facing the floor, snuffing out what little light was in the
			room.
		<p>
			"Ehehehe. You're actually a lot like a rotisserie chicken, in the way that I want to take a nibble of both.
			Except unlike one, you're right in front of me."
		<p>
			In the dark, dazed from being knocked down onto the tracks, Vera cannot tell what's happening until she
			feels a stinging pain in her left shoulder. She then hears the sound of Maddie giggling once again.
		<p>
			"Don't worry, you'll be fine. I just really felt like making you shut up and this seemed like a great way to
			do it."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera gets a curse word in before she impacts the floor of the pit. Gravel has been piling up here for some
			time, and Vera groans out in pain even before the different sensation of the bite. She breathes thin, and
			she pushes Maddie off of her side and struggles to her feet. She lifts her tablet, and its tough screen is
			cracked.
		<p>
			“What is your issue? I can understand an insult, and I can almost even understand attacking me, but biting
			too? Where is your self-control? How does this show me anything about you?”
		<p>
			So much for making her shut up. Vera's voice drips with venom but tapers with, again, fear. She barely walks
			on.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hey, cats bite and scratch people all the time. You don't need to be so mad over it. And honestly, I think
			this will teach you much more about my situation than any explanation I could come up with."
		<p>
			Maddie quietly walks up to Vera, a bandage in her hand, probably pulled from the pouch on her belt.
		<p>
			"Hold still. I won't bite you again, promise. I'm just going to stop the bleeding. I wanted a nibble, not a
			dead body."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			The field researcher stops moving and folds her arms. She's tense and silent for the duration of Maddie's
			first aid.
		<p>
			She then continues forward, and she mumbles, “Yeah, this has taught me cat people are prone to being more
			cat than human.” She says, louder, “I still don't understand what you mean by this educating me about you.
			Are you using sarcasm?”
		<p>
			Vera places the broken tablet into her sash. The flashlight had turned off, as did the screen lighting. She
			sighs.
		<p>
			“Please don't hurt me anymore, then. I'll cooperate. Please.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I don't plan on hurting you anymore. I don't really like hurting people, in all honesty. Come, the end of
			this old tunnel is quite close."
		<p>
			Maddie leads the way, taking Vera's hand to guide her through the darkness. After a while longer of walking,
			it exits to an old abandoned station, in a quiet portion of the city. Surprisingly, it's quite overgrown,
			with golden light streaming in through numerous holes in the ceiling. A rusted old subway car lies on the
			tracks, immobile for who knows how long.
		<p>
			"This is my house! Come on, you look like you need to sit down."
		<p>
			As Maddie is walking through the station, she spots a child looking at them, a young boy no older than 10.
		<p>
			"Shouldn't you be going home soon, Jacob? It's getting late, you don't want to worry your mother!"
		<p>
			Although he looks disappointed at being told to leave, he begrudgingly complies, waving goodbye to Maddie
			and heading off out of sight.
		<p>
			"Sorry about that. I sometimes play with the local kids to keep them company."
		<p>
			Maddie chuckles.
		<p>
			"They say their parents never believe them when they tell them about a cat who's also a person."
		<p>
			Maddie leads Vera to the old subway, pushing open a door whose hinges were clearly attached to the frame
			with duct tape and effort. Inside, a surprisingly cozy space awaits. An old mattress lies in the corner,
			with a table and a pair of mismatched chairs set at it.
		<p>
			"Here, have a seat or lie down. You can pick whatever."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			She is much quieter, again. Maddie telling her to shut up, along with her impossible reaction time and
			speed, bobs at the top of Vera's mind. And she mulls over what questions she could have been asking, what
			way to clarify anything about the last several minutes...
		<p>
			Her eyes brighten at the exotic and well-lit scene, however. It's something out of an urban fantasy novel—a
			secret grove buried at the heart of a metropolis. Of course, it's also full of grime and mold and bugs and,
			really, the thought anyone could consider this a home begs questions about the health of her captor.
		<p>
			She watches the kid run away, and she says, “I have a lot of questions, Maddie.”
		<p>
			The mattress is inviting, even being her messy captor's bed. Vera's legs are sore. So, reluctantly, Vera
			lowers onto the mattress and rolls up the bottom of her white, utilitarian pants, checking herself for
			gashes with the granite. She can only find bruises here, and she'd refuse to show any more of her leg than
			this around Maddie.
		<p>
			She lowers her knee. “Thank you for showing me your home. If my tablet still worked, I'd be writing
			everything I see. For my job. Thanks for that.”
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I've never actually bitten someone like that before. I usually know it's a very bad idea... but this time I
			just felt like I had to. Like a compulsion."
		<p>
			Maddie pulls out a couple of mugs from a box, filling them with water. She then carefully plugs a microwave
			into a shoddily crafted array of AA batteries, careful not to electrocute herself. She puts the mugs in,
			and, miraculously, the microwave hums as it warms up the water. She takes them out, adding a couple packets
			of hot chocolate powder from a brand new box of hot chocolate mix.
		<p>
			"Here, have something warm to drink. You probably are starting to feel a little bit woozy now."
		<p>
			Vera's head has been starting to ache mildly, not that she hit it very hard when she fell.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"The percentage of you that is cat took over your human reasoning, I'm sure."
		<p>
			Vera shuts one of her eyes as Maddie fiddles with the unregulated power unit with the microwave. She exhales
			only after the microwave turns back off, and she extends her hand for the mug of hot chocolate. She then
			stares into the drink. It is clean to her surprise—even with the powder having spread throughout, the water
			has no foul odor or color.
		<p>
			"I can confirm I feel strange. There's something you're not telling me. There is always something people
			don't tell me. Furthermore, I hope you have not lied to me yet. People also lie to me. Would you let me
			leave tomorrow, if I asked?"
		<p>
			She rubs her forehead.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well, now we run into the tricky issue that you know where I live, and whoever you work for that sent you
			to 'research' me will probably send more people after me. So I'm really not sure how to go about this."
		<p>
			Maddie gulps down half of her mug of hot chocolate in one continuous sip.
		<p>
			"You should sleep now, you'll probably feel better in the morning."
		<p>
			Vera is still woozy and also aching from her bruises and whatever has happened.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			"I promise you I'm peaceful and that I'm the only person you'd be seeing from where I'm from."
		<p>
			Well, unless Vera doesn't indicate that she's alive for a while. There's a possibility, then, that the Field
			Research Department would send a couple of her coworkers. She sips from her hot chocolate beverage. It's
			fine.
		<p>
			"I understand you're still worried, however. Therefore—okay—I guess I'll be your prisoner. That is, likely,
			what you're implying. Maybe I will bore you soon enough."
		<p>
			Her assignments never seem to go to plan. She sighs and places the mug aside, and she lies on her back.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well, make yourself comfortable for now. I'm going to go shopping once you're asleep, do you want me to get
			you anything?"
		<p>
			Maddie turns around, carefully unplugging the batteries from the microwave, and then sits down on the
			ladder-back chair, looking out one of the cracked but still solid windows of the train car.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Vera reaches into her sash again and removes about thirty dollars. She waves them above her head.
		<p>
			"A delicious meal, please. Like a burger, or a nice steak, or shrimp scampi. Pay with this."
		<p>
			Maddie might get the idea to steal from her wallet, but assignment funds have been stolen before, and it's
			better than stealing from stores in Vera's name.
	</div>
	<div class="wrap StreetMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie snatches the money from her, stuffing it into a pouch.
		<p>
			"Steak sounds good. Let me go check if the grill is working; it's been a while since I got to have something
			that good. Usually the meat section has a lot of people around and it's hard to get a steak."
		<p>
			Maddie disappears out the door. As Vera is lying down trying to rest, she hears the sound of muffled
			clattering from outside and then hears a sound somewhere between a woman yelping and a cat meowing in
			surprise. Then, a string of curses. A few minutes later, Maddie reappears at the door.
		<p>
			"Yeah, the grill's working fine. I'll be back in like an hour. Try to sleep a bit. I'll wake you up when the
			food is ready."
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Vera_w">
		<p>
			Maddie wanting to share the meal is unexpected to the field researcher. Town, she supposes, is odder in how
			its meals are highly individualized compared to the rest of the world—even odd for a petty thief,
			apparently. She huffs when Maddie returns.
		<p>
			"Okay. I won't be any help for grilling. I skipped the culinary electives. Did you burn yourself? Come back,
			please."
		<p>
			Vera finds herself falling asleep soon, which conflicts with her plan to at least snoop through the cat
			girl's possessions or even to run away to guaranteed safety. Oh well...
