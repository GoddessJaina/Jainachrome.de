			Maddie and Keria emerge from the water elm tree into a park lined with them. A stream cuts through a dip in
			the
			grass,
			and park benches dot a sidewalk through the park until it bends off to the side and out of sight. It's noon,
			and
			the
			tree canopy provides little shade. There's a distinct scent of fish first and ocean second.
		<p>
			The edge of the park is close by to a one-way road, and several outlets and local businesses line the other
			side. A clam
			chowder establishment is packed with a line stretching to outside its entrance, and—conveniently—a chocolate
			storefront
			is just two stores over. A large hanging sign reads "Gobeli and Son's," and a special offer for five
			assorted
			bars is
			plastered on the board sidewalk sign.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria looks out over the landscape as she turns to Maddie, smiling a little bit.
		<p>
			"Okay, you're at the helm for this. I'll follow your lead!"
		<p>
			Her stature and appearance start to seem a bit more strange juxtaposed on this relatively normal-looking
			town.
			She
			stands nearly a foot over most of the other people here and she's already getting a few stares from the
			handful
			of
			park-goers nearby.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie spots the chocolate store, and points toward it excitedly.
		<p>
			"Can we go there? Maybe they have hot chocolate or something. Or normal chocolate. That's good too."
		<p>
			Maddie starts walking towards it, not noticing the stares Keria is getting. The passersby would probably
			notice
			her
			too-real cat ears and tail if they hadn't been looking at Keria.


	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			Nobody interrupts the odd couple, however, beyond a spunky teenager demanding a selfie with Keria. And they
			cross the
			road at an opportune time, jaywalking as everybody else seems to be.
		<p>
			Gobeli and Son's prides itself as "Seamont's Oldest Chocolatier" on a poster with finer text on the window.
			And,
			when
			Maddie leads Keria inside, the eccentric and intricate interior shows that age. The beige and brown color
			scheme
			has
			become something yellow and brown instead, and a couple of the display cases have small cracks. There's a
			central island
			of these cases, surrounding a cashier's desk stylized to resemble a podium, and the walls are lined with
			shelves
			of
			other unique chocolate varieties. Interestingly, a couple of expensive cakes are in the main display
			alongside
			the
			company's own chocolate.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			"Welcome and—wow, look at that, you're the tallest person I've ever seen. That's honestly hard to believe!"
		<p>
			The man standing at the desk smiles broadly. He slicks his brown hair back, revealing his tasteful
			sideburns,
			and he
			walks back around so that he can shake Keria and Maddie's hands personally. He's wearing a vintage leather
			jacket over
			pale flannel.
		<p>
			"Anyway, I'm Ruedi Gobeli. I'm the owner of this place. I understand you're probably new here. Well, don't
			worry, I can
			show you around. Do you prefer light, milk, or dark varieties of chocolate?—And what's your names? I'm dying
			to
			know.
			Nice ears. Quite nice."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Clyde_w">
		<p>
			A quiet, late teen mops someone's spill of soda at the opposite end of the store. He's wearing a pink tie
			that
			matches
			his pink hair.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria is taken aback at Ruedi's almost 'used car salesman' levels of overbearing kindness, and chuckles
			quietly
			as she
			introduces herself.
		<p>
			"I'm... Keria. And yes, very new here, in a way. As for the chocolate, don't worry, I've already got some of
			my
			favorite
			here."
		<p>
			Keria reaches into her bag and takes out a bar of chocolate wrapped in brightly colored plastic, but... the
			language on
			the front is entirely unintelligible, completely unlike any language Ruedi or Maddie have ever seen. She
			casually pulls
			off two chunks, eating one and offering the other to Ruedi.
		<p>
			"Wanna try it? 99.9 percent certain you've not had this brand before."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie looks up at Keria, a slightly annoyed expression on her face.
		<p>
			"Heyy, why didn't you offer me some earlier? I want some, why didn't you tell me you had this back on the
			other
			side of
			the tree! Honestly, you probably could've given me them back in my glass world, that would've been even
			better."
		<p>
			She pouts, exaggerating how annoyed she is about the chocolate.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria chuckles at Maddie's annoyance, and glances down at her.
		<p>
			"Once you've been to enough worlds you'd understand. I've met creatures whose insides would practically melt
			if
			they ate
			this. It's a rule not to offer unless in an emergency."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh come on I was literally engulfed in the unmatched power of the sun for over a hundred years and I'm
			fine!
			Although I
			suppose that would make it the matched power of the sun, because it couldn't destroy me."
		<p>
			Maddie's ears flatten down as she ponders this, her tail waving gently.
		<p>
			"Anyways... pleeaaaseee can I have some? I'll be fine!"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria ponders for a moment, shrugging at her.
		<p>
			"You make a compelling point. Can't much deny it, so... here."
		<p>
			Keria pulls a square off and hands it to Maddie, ruffling her hair some.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie smiles, happy that she managed to get the chocolate. Her tail wags back and forth with delight as she
			takes the
			square, biting into it. She gives Keria a contented smile, definitely having enjoyed the chocolate.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			Ruedi had slowly slipped away from the alien druid and catgirl. He crouches beside the pink-haired teen with
			the
			mop and
			gestures at the two repeatedly and frantically. The boy looks like he's about to cry, then, and he runs off
			to
			an
			employee door to the side of the store, locking it. And then Ruedi gathers his breath and walks to the front
			entrance of
			the store.
		<p>
			"Hey, my beloved regulars and special guests," He says, loudly, "There is an unfortunate family emergency!
			Please vacate
			the premises and the store will resume as soon as I open the doors again. Thank you."
		<p>
			He leans over Maddie, however, gently patting her shoulder. Other customers stream out of the store, buying
			into
			Ruedi's
			lie on his good reputation alone.
		<p>
			"Before you two leave, would it be alright if you humor me? I was hoping I could learn more about your
			favorite
			chocolate, Keria."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria's hand tightens over her bag, the sudden shift in atmosphere setting off some alarm bells in her head.
			Most people
			would simply assume she's crazy or just having a laugh, but something's off about this. After a moment of
			sifting
			through her options, she settles on the simplest one.
		<p>
			"Very well. What is it you want to know? I'll be honest."
		<p>
			Keria subtly pulls Maddie away from Ruedi, glancing around the room a bit.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			He smiles, and his hands drift nearby the inside pockets of his leather jacket.
		<p>
			"I heard her and you come from a different world altogether. And seeing as you're seemingly made of plants
			and
			this
			other one claims to be immortal, I want to know how you're here. And, anyway, did you come here just to buy
			my
			chocolate? That just sounds like a missed opportunity. However, I can give you some. Milk chocolate seems to
			be
			your
			taste..."
		<p>
			He tries to circle to behind them and then guide them forward to the back of the store.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria places a firm foot down on the ground as she stares at Ruedi, towering over the man and not letting
			his
			act get to
			her.
		<p>
			"I'm surprised you take our existence at face value. This one..."
		<p>
			Keria puts a hand on Maddie.
		<p>
			"—Has not had a single thing to drink in an eternity. We traveled to a random place on a whim, saw a
			chocolate
			shop, and
			she wanted some hot chocolate. We did, indeed, come here just for that. So, allow her a drink. No need to
			head
			back
			there. We'll be staying right here."
		<p>
			Keria's mind wanders to the crying teenager... clearly something is up with that, it's the last place she
			wants
			to end
			up.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie moves slightly behind Keria, half obscured by the much taller woman.
		<p>
			"I was just trapped alone in a completely empty world for over a thousand years... it's been so long since I
			had
			hot
			chocolate, it was always my favorite drink."
		<p>
			Clearly a bit scared of the situation, her tail is down and her ears flattened down as well. She didn't seem
			to
			notice
			the crying young man, as she had been too distracted looking at the various chocolates."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			While Maddie does this Keria keeps a reassuring hand on her and whispers to her, "It's okay, we're perfectly
			safe."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			He tilts his head, recognizing Keria's challenge. He takes a key chain from his jacket and unlocks a cabinet
			with a
			powdered chocolate mix, grabbing a few packets and stuffing them into his pocket. He locks the cabinet
			again,
			and he
			sits on a stool close to them. And he folds his hands together.
		<p>
			"Hot chocolate was always one of my favorites too. What was your name again? You're telling me you sat bored
			for
			one
			thousand years? Didn't eat anything, didn't drink anything—you had nothing? I'm sorry."
		<p>
			He coughs into his shoulder.
		<p>
			"Unlike you, I'm going to die someday. I think about that a lot. What about you, Keria? Do you think about
			how
			she is
			going to outlive you? What will she think of you then?"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yep. Nothing but a glass wasteland. I lived in a lab for a year before it happened, they kept injecting me
			with
			things
			every day. Then, one day, some people accidentally made the sun explode. Turns out the experiments made me
			immortal, and
			so I just had to sit in the empty world forever. Until Keria found me."
		<p>
			Maddie glances at the hot chocolate mix, eyeing them greedily.
		<p>
			"Also, I don't think I'm going to outlive Keria. Nor will she outlive me. She's much, much older than I am."
			Maddie puts
			a hand on her chin, thinking. "I'm pretty sure she's older than the universe."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria nods as Maddie speaks.
		<p>
			"I am an integral part of the way reality functions. I cannot die nor be killed. Even if my body is entirely
			destroyed,
			it will simply come back."
		<p>
			Keria smiles a gentle but piercing smile, clearly unbothered by anything Ruedi may try.
		<p>
			"Now... I've been honest with you, return the favor. What did you send that boy off for? And why was he so
			upset?"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			"I'll take your word for it, Keria. I'll take your word for it. Well, you know me, I'm just—a chocolatier.
			It's
			in the
			family. I make people smile. Mostly children. I don't even leave the city much. That's what I have."
		<p>
			He sighs, and he presses two fingers hard into his forehead. Seconds later, he grabs the hot chocolate
			pouches
			from his
			jacket pocket and stares at Maddie. He slaps them into her hand.
		<p>
			"That boy is my assistant Clyde. He was just scared by the two of you. You still haven't told me your name,
			cat-eared
			girl."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I'm Maddie. Don't have a last name anymore. Forgot it."
		<p>
			She stuffs the hot chocolate pouches into the pocket of her hoodie, keeping them safe as if they were her
			only
			possession in the world. Perhaps, because they are.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria simply nods and stares at Maddie some before speaking up again, looking back to Ruedi.
		<p>
			"Now… have you vacated your store simply out of a desire to speak to us? It seems a touch unnecessary. And
			it
			seems to
			have given Maddie quite a scare. Perhaps it was partially on us for being so open about our natures, but…
			very
			few have
			reacted like you did to this news, and I must say I'm quite curious as to why. It was most unexpected."
		<p>
			Keria takes another bite of her chocolate bar, curiously looking around the store some as she waits for a
			response.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			He glances out the windows of the store, across Seamont Park and at the skyscrapers of downtown. He's old
			sometimes.
		<p>
			"You should understand that I'm not used to things with your 'natures'. Neither are my customers. The most
			reasonable
			course of action seemed to be that I'd just whip up some privacy for us and we'd get to have a nice
			conversation. But,
			more than that, I have to admit I would have missed a huge opportunity in not learning more. So, before you
			both
			go on
			your merry way, maybe with a few more free chocolates of your choosing, could I extend your visit in my
			life?—Like,
			would you like to see how a chocolate factory works? Have you ever been somewhere like that? It's not quite
			like
			in the
			movies."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie tugs on Keria's arm.
		<p>
			"C'mon, wasn't the point of this for me to have new experiences? It'll be fun. What's the worst that could
			happen; it's
			not like he can kill or hurt us."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria stops and thinks for a long few moments before slowly nodding.
		<p>
			"Yes, you have a point. I'm quite curious about this man, despite the... interesting introduction."
		<p>
			Keria leans close to Ruedi so that Maddie cannot hear the following very well.
		<p>
			"I know you're gonna try something. Be a dear and just don't. It'll save you a lot of hassle."
		<p>
			She smiles widely as she returns to Maddie and ruffles her hair some.
		<p>
			"We can have a bit of a tour, not like we have much else to do."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			The man shakes his head and walks ahead to the door at the back of the store floor, opening the set of locks
			with two
			keys from his keychain. His hands are shivering.
		<p>
			"I'm so impressed by you that I'm offering you a tour of my company's secrets for no charge, and you
			otherworldly
			visitors are suggesting I'm some kind of wicked buffoon? Nothing I could say could really express how
			offended I
			am.
			Might I suggest that we start making amends? I'm just trying to get on your good graces in my lonely life.
			Isn't
			that
			obvious?"
		<p>
			He dips into his private office on the side of the hallway, which to begin with is obscenely long and quiet.
			Then he
			returns seconds later, and he continues to the last door. There's a muffled noise of someone talking behind
			it.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria leans against the wall inside the hallway, her arms crossed as she waits for Ruedi, beckoning Maddie
			over
			as they
			both wait for him
		<p>
			"I have no idea why he's still taking us on this tour, but hey, I'm not complaining. Who knows, maybe he's
			just
			gonna
			play it straight after all this."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie tilts her head, one of her ears perked up into the air, the other flattened down. She listens, trying
			to
			hear the
			voice through the wall. She hears a person's nervous voice, one voicing prayers of desperation.
		<p>
			"Someone's... praying? They sound really nervous," Maddie whispers to Keria.
	</div>

	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			He unlocks the door to the factory, and he returns his hands to his inside jacket pockets. He leans on the
			door,
			pushing
			it open slowly, and Maddie and Keria enter the production floor. He coughs into his arm.
		<p>
			The whimsical colors and art deco design of the store are nowhere here. It's gray here, with sharp, cold
			edges
			and
			corners. Some deactivated, basic machines are in the center of the room—one seems to process chocolate in
			some
			form, and
			another seems to package chocolate into assorted wrappers.
		<p>
			The man Maddie hears praying is behind metal bars—a prison cell. There's at least a dozen of these, but the
			other
			prisoners were sleeping, crying silently, or laying on the floor silently. Now, however, they mostly turn
			their
			heads to
			Keria, Maddie, and Ruedi. Some of them shout at them.
		<p>
			Ruedi, with practiced sleight-of-hand, whips a white towelette drenched in some sweet chemical toward
			Keria's
			mouth and
			nose.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Reacting with catlike agility, Maddie pounces, flinging herself at Ruedi. With slightly too-sharp nails, she
			claws at
			his face leaving scrapes just deep enough to draw blood. She screams at him, staying on top of him
			face-to-face
			looking
			absolutely feral.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			She barely even blinks at Ruedi's attempt as she turns to see Maddie pounce. Keria, after watching for a few
			moments,
			calmly walks over and lifts Maddie up by the back of her shirt's collar, not even breaking her smile from
			before. It's
			almost scary when contrasted with the prisoners that Ruedi keeps.
		<p>
			"Now now, Maddie. We knew this would happen. I assure you, chemicals like this do basically nothing. See,
			they
			work on a
			principle of human biology that—"
		<p>
			Keria interrupts herself as she grabs the towel with her free hand.
		<p>
			"Now likely isn't the best time to ramble... just observe."
		<p>
			She lifts the towlette to her nose and takes a long, deep whiff of the fabric, to no effect.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			The prisoners holler and harass Ruedi as he wipes his right hand across his face, blood on his fingers. He
			stares at the
			ever-optimistic Keria comforting the catgirl and making a fool of him with his rag of chloroform. He pants.
			His
			voice is
			this gruff, loud thing.
		<p>
			"Go back from where you came, and tell nobody about this place! Can I have your word? Keria? Maddie?"
		<p>
			A particularly skinny prisoner with a long dragon tattoo on his neck says, "He's full of shit! Kill him!" A
			woman with
			dark nails says, "Free me. I'll do anything, just, please."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie goes limp for a moment when Keria grabs her by the collar, but hearing the prisoners' pleas, she
			wriggles
			from
			her grip and leans over Ruedi.
		<p>
			"How do I open the cells? Where is the key?"
		<p>
			She plucks the chloroform rag from Keria's hand, holding it vaguely threateningly near Ruedi.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			Blood drips on his eyelashes. He glares at Maddie, and he says, "Go home and drink your hot chocolate.
			You've
			waited
			long enough."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria puts a finger to her chin as she thinks.
		<p>
			"Well... I tend to dislike meddling in the lives of people from the various dimensions... I'm not sure I
			would
			feel
			right in doing much of anything about this. I don't belong after all."
		<p>
			Keria smiles slyly as she glances over to Maddie.
		<p>
			"However, I won't stop Maddie from perhaps freeing some prisoners. If she so chooses. Though I'm sure it
			will be
			bad
			news for our friend here."
		<p>
			Keria shrugs and walks on over to Ruedi, pulling a small bottle of alcohol and a clean rag out of her bag,
			setting them
			nearby to Ruedi.
		<p>
			"Clean off those cuts, don't want them to get infected!"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie begins searching the factory for the key, ignoring the bleeding man on the floor. She finds a section
			of
			shelves,
			where various substances lie in beakers and bottles. Seeing one that looks vaguely like apple juice, Maddie
			walks over
			to it.
		<p>
			"Is this apple juice? I'm gonna have some."
		<p>
			She grabs the beaker with both hands, and chugs the contents of it. It's sickly sweet, and she has a sour
			expression on
			her face.
		<p>
			"That... was not apple juice."
		<p>
			Maddie clutches her stomach, feeling sick. A wave of nausea washes over her, and she stays like that,
			swaying,
			for a
			moment.
		<p>
			"Does anyone have a bucket…?"
		<p>
			She looks around and sees a large empty beaker, which for her purposes is good enough. She rushes over to
			it,
			bends
			down, and then begins vomiting into it. The vomit looks like a stream of chocolate milk, which is both
			humorous
			and
			disgusting. The beaker almost fills, and then Maddie groans, wiping her mouth.
		<p>
			"Why do you have that? Why do you have a drink that makes you puke chocolate milk? Oh by the way, do you
			want
			some,
			Ruedi?"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			He stumbles back against the wall, where he takes the cleaning rag to the alcohol and cleans off his face.
			He's
			a
			freckled man, something he maintains from spending a lot of time in the afternoon sun when he hadn't yet
			inherited the
			family business.
		<p>
			"If you free these prisoners, Maddie, you're going to ruin my life. There will be no more 'Gobeli and
			Son's'.
			I'll go to
			jail. Speaking of which, do you even know who you're trying to free? I think it's time to explain myself..."
		<p>
			One of the inmates yells, "Good people!"
		<p>
			"No, not good people. These are people who have committed felonies." He points at the inmate. "He robbed
			stores." He
			points at the woman with black nails. "She raped her ex. This is an alternative for a life-sentence. I work
			with
			the
			local prison."
		<p>
			He stares at Maddie and her chocolate milk puke, unamused. "I use that on these awful people. It's a family
			recipe. They
			get to die, and I get to sell my famous chocolate."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria crouches down and stares Ruedi down, getting very close to his face and studying him for a long
			moment.
			She
			narrows her eyes at him and stands back up, looming over the man.
		<p>
			"I trust him, Maddie. He doesn't seem to be lying, so… do what you will with that. That said…"
		<p>
			Keria walks over to the cages and points at the supposed robber before crouching down to be on their level.
		<p>
			"Tell me, did you choose to be here? Would you rather be in prison? Surely just a robbery wouldn't deserve…
			this."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			The inmate says, "I stole from a Ben's Footwear, think I want to be mutilated into fuckin' candy? Please get
			me
			out of
			here!" The other prisoners chime in on that request.
		<p>
			Ruedi sighs. "I read about you on the report the Seamont police department sent me for you all. You stole
			thousands of
			dollars of inventory of shoes. Keria, he's nothing but a third-rate criminal. Just leave this place and
			never
			come
			back."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Locked up... for life... for stealing a few thousand dollars of shoes? And now you're going to kill him,
			for
			this? You
			think someone deserves death for this?"
		<p>
			Maddie carefully steps over to Ruedi and then scratches at his face once more, this time with much more
			force,
			leaving a
			set of bleeding gashes across his face.
		<p>
			"You're a psychopath! I sat, imprisoned on an empty world for a thousand years. I know what being locked up
			is
			like.
			It's awful. These people may be bad, but they don't deserve this. Maybe you should try some of your own
			juice.
			Do you
			want to become chocolate, punishment for the hundreds you've killed?"
		<p>
			She stares at him, with the pent up emotion of a thousand years of nothing.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria stands and slowly walks over to Maddie, standing between her and Ruedi, Keria's usual smile replaced
			by a
			sorrowful frown.
		<p>
			"Maddie, I… I know how you must feel, but… Killing him won't make you feel better. He may be a psychopath,
			but
			that
			doesn't mean you can take his life as he took the lives of so many others. You won't be happy, or satisfied,
			or
			anything
			of the sort."
		<p>
			Keria crouches down to be face to face with Maddie, her somber expression deepening even more.
		<p>
			"I'm… no stranger to doing something like that, and it's never once been worth it."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie looks back at her, then to the blood on her hand.
		<p>
			"I- I wasn't going to kill him. I just wanted him to feel some pain."
		<p>
			She turns to Ruedi, slightly calmer now.
		<p>
			"Where is the key to free the prisoners? Let them out. If you are imprisoned and financially ruined, it's
			still
			a better
			fate than what you had planned for them." She points at the cells.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			"Please don't hurt me anymore!" Ruedi shouts. He shivers, too stiff with panic to even address the fresh
			streams
			of
			blood on his expression. "I didn't choose anything you—you ungrateful twat. It's a family business; go talk
			to
			my
			great-grandfather. This is his doing!"
		<p>
			While Keria is distracted talking with Maddie about the morality of dealing with someone like Ruedi, Mr.
			Gobeli
			himself
			quickly whips out a syringe of the alchemical chocolate-making solution from under his jacket and jams it
			into
			Keria's
			arm. It diffuses throughout the druid's arm, and it becomes something brown and crumbly and not quite right.
		<p>
			He drops the syringe on the ground, then, and he wipes his face again with the cloth of alcohol. The
			adrenaline
			leaves
			him in an instant.
		<p>
			He says, "What if I don't let them out, Maddie?"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			It takes Keria a few moments to realize what's happening, staring down at her arm blankly.
		<p>
			"Ah. That was really quite a tenacious move! Attacking the one trying to keep you from getting killed tends
			to
			be quite
			a bad idea, Mr. Gobeli."
		<p>
			Keria pokes and prods at her chocolatized arm curiously as she speaks.
		<p>
			"However, a family business is a useless excuse. Nobody forced you to keep doing this, the tradition could
			have
			died. It
			is not my place to make moral judgment calls, but at least think up a better excuse."
		<p>
			As Keria talks, as if it were nothing at all, she grabs her arm by the shoulder and just yanks it off. It
			makes
			a
			uniquely sickening crunch; halfway between the crunch of a thick branch snapping and the breaking of bone.
			She
			tosses
			the half-chocolate arm aside haphazardly as a small flower buds where the missing arm was detached from. The
			inside of
			her wound is... odd. It's a pale white much like her skin but nonetheless has a distinct fibrous, plant-like
			appearance.
			A new arm quickly grows out of the bud; it's extremely pale white, even moreso than her skin normally is.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie looks at Keria, first with confusion, then wonder.
		<p>
			"That's... so cool..." She says, watching the new arm grow back. "You get to do that and all I get is vomit.
			Hmmph."
		<p>
			She turns back to Ruedi, looking down at him once more.
		<p>
			"Give up already. Can't you tell fighting us is pointless? Just give us the key and we'll stop bothering
			you."
		<p>
			The idea that they could search him has eluded Maddie.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			Ruedi stares at Keria's regrown anatomy in a perverse fashion. The absurdity brings himself to chuckle.
		<p>
			He reaches for Maddie's shoulder again, too slowly to really connect. He then sits down on the dull
			concrete. He
			can't
			hear the prisoners anymore.
		<p>
			"None of you take me seriously. It's like I'm a joke. Like I'm not even worth your breath. What do you want
			me
			to tell
			you? I'm too much of a fucking coward? I could never free them. I'm even too scared to free myself."
		<p>
			He throws his other syringe in his pocket across the floor, where it cracks and pools the magical liquid on
			the
			floor.
		<p>
			"If you're forcing me to share my keys, I want you to then exonerate me. Like, kill me. Before I change my
			mind."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria turns around, crouching down to make eye contact with Ruedi, her face still dark and solemn.
		<p>
			"Mr. Gobeli, I see you as no joke... You are, as I see you now, a pathetic whelp of a man. But you needn't
			be. I
			can see
			in your eyes that your wickedness is not at the very core of your being. There is no way to atone for what
			you've done,
			but this does not need to continue. Instead of dying the death of a pathetic coward, why not use what you
			have
			left to
			make amends?"
		<p>
			Keria stands up and holds out her freshly grown arm, inviting him to stand up using it.
		<p>
			"I want you to go and release those prisoners yourself. Don't worry, I think I can make them... repress the
			memory of
			being here. I'm not sure how my companion would feel about giving you a second chance, but if we do I will
			be
			sure to
			check in frequently. I have all the time in the world, you know."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			"What really are you, Keria? Are you God? Are you Mother Nature herself? Why are you doing this to me?"
		<p>
			He accepts Keria's hand after a long pause, lifting himself off the floor. He stares at the first prisoner
			in
			the line,
			a man who already lies down on a dirty blanket on the brink of death.
		<p>
			"Nobody who I have ever showed the factory to has told me that... That I'm not wicked at my core—what you
			said.
			I'm not
			sure I believe you. It's like 'Mr. Gobeli' is a name that changes people."
		<p>
			He sighs, patting down the inside of his pockets for the keychain and singling out one key. He unlocks the
			inmate's
			cell. He kicks it open. And he continues to the next cell, and so on. He gives time for Keria to use her
			magic
			on the
			freed prisoners.
		<p>
			"Do you understand how impossible your request is, Keria and Maddie?"


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria reaches into her bag, waving what seems to be a small branch in front of the individuals as they leave
			the
			cells,
			muttering instructions to each of them quietly. None seem to resist Keria. Forgetting about this whole place
			is
			on the
			top of their priority list.
		<p>
			Keria wordlessly waits to let Maddie respond, certain the cat is still bursting with emotion.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie, staying silent for the duration of their exchange, finally speaks.
		<p>
			"Can't you just like... make chocolate the way everyone else does? You know how to make weird magic
			chocolate
			stuff.
			Surely it wouldn't be that hard to just make normal chocolate."
		<p>
			Maddie gives him a quizzical look and then glances around, the look changing to a smile as she sees the
			prisoners
			leaving the room.


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			Ruedi stuffs his keys back away, watching the last of the prisoners shuffle out into the hallway. They'd be
			able
			to
			leave through the front entrance of the store, and he's more than aware that the Seamont Police would
			institute
			a very
			angry conversation with the chocolatier, possibly even fatal.
		<p>
			It crosses his mind that his assistant Clyde may notice the prisoners leaving, too. So, he sighs and enters
			back
			into
			the hallway himself.
		<p>
			"Leave me alone, Maddie."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Keria_w">
		<p>
			Keria sighs and walks with Ruedi some, a look of pity on her face.
		<p>
			"Ruedi… good luck. Don't waste your second chance. I'll make sure to check in, and you had better not be
			doing
			this
			again. Trust me."


	</div>
	<div class="wrap Ruedi_w">
		<p>
			"I believe you, Keria. I believe you."
