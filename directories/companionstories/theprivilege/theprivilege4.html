    <div class="wrap Keria_w">
      <p>
        There's a large opening at the base, and Clyde walks out into a massive forest with trees reaching up into the
        sky, forming a dense, impenetrable canopy overhead. Nonetheless, what seems like sunlight filters down from the
        canopy. A variety of familiar animals and plants litter the lush ground, though some of them look a bit... off.
        It's nothing immediately apparent, but they just seem not quite like what Clyde remembers.
      </p>

      <p>"Alright, home sweet home. 10 or 15 minutes of walking and we'll be at the place we're staying."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie jumps through the exit after them looking around and smiling. She enjoys being in the forest, with its
        dappled sunlight and lush plant life.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I can't wait to have some real, actual chocolate milk when we get back! Also, Keria, is there even enough beds?
        There was just the one last time we were here."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Clyde_w">
      <p>
        Clyde approaches many instances of the impressive trees and eccentric plants, running his fingers along their
        surfaces. He snips a few flowers from their stems, and he laughs with delight. Walks in the forest always have
        an air of magic to them, to be fair to natural beauty, but this is more like when he first camped with his
        brothers in the woods outside of Schokokuss, before he really knew what mushrooms, vegetation, and fauna to
        anticipate.
      </p>

      <p>"I'll sleep on the floor if there's not enough beds," He says with no irony.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Keria_w">
      <p>
        Keria never quite seems used to the wonders of the forest. Despite her age, a certain childlike wonder has yet
        to fully dissipate. She always seems to have a gentle smile when wandering through her domain. Perhaps it's only
        natural that such a wonder would be baked into her very essence. She glances back at Clyde as she smiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        "There is only one bed, but I am sure Maddie can sleep at the foot of it, or on the couch. I am the one who
        sleeps outside. I find it hard to properly sleep indoors."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
      <p>
        "I'm pretty content to just curl up at the foot of the bed. I actually prefer sleeping curled up to sleeping
        lying down usually. It's cozy!"
      </p>

      <p>
        She quickly climbs up a tree just for fun, nimbly hopping down and running around a bit as they continue
        walking.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Clyde_w">
      <p>
        Clyde imagines Keria resting with a blanket of twigs and leaves, standing up. He nods and then stops walking
        again to forage some pulpy green berries from a bushel.
      </p>

      <p>"If she is o-okay with s-sleeping in the same room."</p>

      <p>
        Sleeping next to a girl would be a first for him. He supposes there's been a lot of firsts today. He goes back
        to examining the berries in his palm.
      </p>

      <p>"Keria, what are these called? Is it s-safe to wash them and eat them?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap Keria_w">
      <p>Keria leans down and pokes at some of the berries, tilting her head.</p>

      <p>
        "I mean... I could eat them. You... it is a gamble. Plants from realities not from your own can have some very
        unexpected effects. Though living beings here do not immediately die due to new foreign diseases; I imagine
        there must be some kind of protection from the most dangerous of effects."
      </p>

      <p>Keria leans back and smiles again.</p>

      <p>"I could cook you something myself, however. I know what is safe and what is not, generally."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wrap SubjectMaddie_w">
      <p>
        Maddie grabs a fistful of berries and starts munching on them happily with absolutely no care for how
        potentially poisonous they are.
      </p>

      <p>"Hey these are tasty! Can we make a pie? I want a pie."</p>
    </div>

      More soon.
