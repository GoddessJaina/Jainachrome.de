	<h1>Mania and the Hopeful Celestial</h1>


	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			High above the shining white streets of a bustling city awash with golden heavenly sunlight, a woman steps
			off of the elevator to the sixteenth floor of a skyscraper, one with pale blue windows and made from white
			bricks lined with gilded carvings. It's immediately apparent that this is no human soul: this is an angel.
			Her pure white hair has a halo atop it, floating above a pair of similarly white cat ears. Behind her, four
			feathery wings are currently folded in, and a two-tipped white cat tail waves behind her. Her outfit
			consists of pale blue office wear, with a dark skirt and a glowing ID in her shirt pocket. She fumbles for a
			moment, and pulls out the ID as she steps up to a large desk that faces away from the glass wall of the
			room, where an angelic woman with four arms sits at a chair, with papers and a computer in front of her. She
			looks up to see who entered the room, a pair of glasses in front of two glowing golden eyes. The cat-angel
			presents her ID, and speaks.
		<p>
			"Hello, it's Maddie, as requested. I assume I'll be given the details as to why I was called up here today?"

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			“Yes. Welcome, one named Maddie. You have been called here because we have found your Assumer.”
		<p>
			She pauses, either to allow the lesser angel time to experience an onslaught of excited emotions or for
			herself to consider her next words. She grabs from the middle of the papers with two hands just the right
			one, and two other palms face up to the ceiling with two other arms. An important gesture.
		<p>
			“Your Assumer has existed for hundreds of years by this time, actually. It's not unusual, one named Maddie,
			for this to occur. We will send you to the Mortal Plane to speak with her where we have found her. It soon
			will likely not be possible to speak with her again for many years. Please represent your learned values and
			understanding to your Assumer.”
		<p>
			She presents the piece of paper to Maddie. It's an address.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			With a mixture of excitement and confusion, Maddie takes the paper, holding it carefully as if it was a
			winning lottery ticket.
		<p>
			"Thank you, Archangel. I'll be on my way to meet her as soon as possible. Is there anything else needed of
			me?"
		<p>
			Maddie fidgets with her tie, clearly resisting the urge to bolt and head to the Mortal Plane as soon as
			possible. She is curious as to why her human has been around for so long and why it is so time sensitive,
			and burns with the desire to find out.

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			"Yes. Please conceal your true identity to your Assumer for the initial meeting period."
		<p>
			The Archangel is repeating standard wisdom on the ceremonial practice of a celestial being meeting their
			Assumer. It's maybe a little annoying, then, but nothing more. Concealing one's identity to their Assumer at
			first is important because it creates a grace period devoid of biases.
		<p>
			"You may now please hurry."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie nods and turns back, heading into the elevator. As she goes down, in a flash of golden light, her
			halo and wings disappear, and her outfit is changed to a pair of jeans, with a light gray t-shirt with the
			logo of a popular human band on it. A leather purse is slung over her shoulder, and she wears a silver
			bracelet. Her cat ears and tail, unlike her wings, remain. She takes a brief walk down the street, arriving
			at a train station. She boards a train bound for a city in the Mortal Realm. The train, seemingly normal at
			first, takes a ninety-degree plunge downwards, although to passengers, no turbulence is felt. About twenty
			minutes later, the train phases into a station in the Mortal Realm, although human onlookers act as if
			nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Maddie steps out, and begins walking towards the listed address.

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			This human station is dirty and rampant with scuffs in the concrete. It's a stark contrast from the pearly
			celestial train. Billboards for bubble tea and a processed, orange corn product are even faded.
		<p>
			The crowd is suffocating, too, and continues even into the narrow streets itself. But many small businesses
			are thriving, at least, because of the rush hour. Decorative paper lanterns dangle from wires.
		<p>
			The address is actually for a fine dining establishment. It's packed, too, and there's a long wait-list.
			Thankfully, however, Maddie has an innate sensation unlike anything she's felt until now. All celestial
			beings have a form of "soul connection" to their Assumers, after all.
		<p>
			And her Assumer is a curvy woman in a suit brandishing her fork like a weapon and cursing at a portly man in
			front of her.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Both excited and nervous, Maddie slowly makes her way to her Assumer, immediately curious as to why such a
			normal looking human would be hundreds of years old. She cautiously makes her way over, waiting for the
			woman to finish her verbal assault upon the man.
		<p>
			Maddie walks up next to her Assumer, nervously trying to get her attention.
		<p>
			"H-hi. Ma'am, can I speak to you for a moment? It's quite important. Sorry if I'm interrupting something.
			But it's very important."
		<p>
			Maddie fidgets a bit, her tail waving nervously as she awaits a response from the highly attractive woman.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			The portly man faces Maddie first, and he says something gentle and confused in Chinese. The woman says
			something else in Chinese to him with a bile forming in her throat, and then she faces the catgirl to spout
			perfect English.
		<p>
			“Get the hell out of here.”
		<p>
			She digs out of her purse a business card and shoves it into Maddie's chest. The card reads, “Maria
			Flecheloo. Venture Capitalist, CEO of Ulterior Inc.” It's then followed by the string “1-666-1776.”
		<p>
			And Maria has already resumed talking to the man, this time putting her fork down and speaking his language
			in a lower voice. She's eaten nothing from her expensive plate. And apparently cat ears don't interest her.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie turns to the man, and her eyes momentarily shift from a deep brown to a shining golden color.
		<p>
			"You're welcome to leave now. Please, child, do so."
		<p>
			The man, although seemingly not able to understand English, somehow perfectly interprets this, then turns
			around and walks away. Maddie turns back to look at 'Maria.'
		<p>
			"Okay, Now that that's dealt with, we. Need. To. Talk."
		<p>
			All shyness is gone from Maddie's voice, replaced now with a slight frustration at being pushed away by the
			woman. Angels weren't used to having people act so rude to them.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Maria stands up abruptly from her chair and glares at the man walking away, and she yells after him probably
			some heinous threats. Then, she finally maintains her attention, undivided, to the angel. She also grabs
			Maddie's wrist.
		<p>
			“You scared my fucking client away! Who do you think you are? The only 'child' here is you—just tell me what
			your damn reason is. You want my services? Are you a humanitarian? Are you stupid?”
		<p>
			She smiles and then frowns and then smiles again. She walks with Maddie out of the restaurant and into the
			lively street, not interested in leaving this place with nothing having been accomplished.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie turns to the woman, her tail waving back and forth in annoyance.
		<p>
			"Okay, you’re going to tell me who the hell you are, and why you've been alive for over two hundred years.
			You're supposed to be long dead. Humans don't live that long."
		<p>
			Maddie glares at her, her white ears twitching.
		<p>
			"As you can clearly see, I'm not a normal person. And also what the hell is up with your phone number?
			That's not standard formatting for any region of the world."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Oh, you definitely have me mistaken for somebody else. Perhaps my mother, or my grandmother, who shared my
			company and likeness.”
		<p>
			She twists Maddie's wrist slightly. She refuses to glare into her eyes now.
		<p>
			“I'm wealthy, idiot. I can maintain a unique phone number. Anything else you're going to waste my time with?
			I don't care that you are a cat, if that's what this is about.”
		<p>
			She pauses, and then lies, “Oh, I know. Tell me what you want and who you are, and then I'll tell you who I
			am.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie's eyes again flicker for a moment, turning golden for a second, and then red for a nearly
			imperceptibly short moment.
		<p>
			"Yeah, you're not old, and I'm Walter Hartwell White. I can tell you're lying, you know. You've been around
			for centuries. Also, on the phone thing. There's still systems in place to keep phone numbers standardized.
			You can't just pay your way into that. Trust me, I know a lot about administrative work. It doesn't work
			like that."
		<p>
			Maddie takes a deep breath and stares at Mania, slightly calmer now.
		<p>
			"Look, I was supposed to meet up with you and figure out more about you. Why are you hiding everything from
			me like this? And lying through your teeth?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania does see Maddie's eyes change color, despite herself. She takes them toward the nearest set of office
			buildings. She pulls harder and walks faster.
		<p>
			“Are you trying to threaten me? You aren't the first person to try and find out the truth about me, you
			know. And yet I tell people all the time. You see, when I tell people, that's not something to be happy
			about. It means you're going to agonize and die, and maybe you'll even suffer forever afterwards too. I'm
			more pissed off that you fucked up my meeting with my client.”
		<p>
			She stretches her back, and she then clutches both of Maddie's shoulders. They keep walking.
		<p>
			“So, what are you, a magical forest elf? An oracle? Just a living lie detector? Are you really that sure
			that you want to keep this up with me?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie chuckles at the mention of "dying" and "suffering forever." The very idea that such a mortal
			consequence could happen to her is amusing.
		<p>
			"Honestly, I could ask the same of you. You probably aren't human anymore, even if you were at some point.
			You'd be long dead from old age. And please, drop the threats, they’re quite ironic."
		<p>
			Maddie tilts her head for a second, thinking. One ear pokes up while the other flattens down, reflecting her
			head tilt.
		<p>
			"Anyways, what's this about a 'client'? What kind of deals do you even make, with your supposed company?
			Should I just call the phone number you gave me and ask there? It's probably easier to just tell me now."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“You got me: I found the Fountain of Youth.”
		<p>
			She rolls her eyes.
		<p>
			“Don't bother calling the phone number—it rings directly to me. I don't have the luxury of competent
			secretaries, remarkably. No, I'll just explain my business myself. I could even break a deal with you, free
			of charge—like, really free of charge, since you're so invested. So, tell me, stranger: Is there anything
			you want more than anything else but just can't seem to ever have? I can help you reach that goal. I'm not
			shitting you, either.”
		<p>
			They enter into the office building's front lobby. Mania lets go of Maddie, sits on a nearby chair, and
			holds her forehead and winces for a searing headache.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hmmm... what do I really want right now? Well... could you please pat my head? Just pet me a bit like a
			cat? I really enjoy that and I haven't had the chance to get some pats in a while."
		<p>
			Maddie looks at Mania with an adorable pleading expression, her ears flattened down like a kitten begging
			for a treat.
		<p>
			"I think that would be a good deal. I get my head patted, and you get to pat my head."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania waits for Maddie to make a real request, but the real request never arrives. She would just leave into
			an elevator on the spot, never to be seen by Maddie again, but it would be better to terminate this loose
			end that is this cat girl.
		<p>
			So, frustrated, Mania removes a black binder from her purse and a red ballpoint pen. She hastily writes
			something on a piece of weathered parchment paper, and she then holds out the pen and parchment for Maddie
			to take.
		<p>
			Some of the words on this contract are eloquently written in cursive—the agreement that Maddie should get
			her head patted by Mania and where it says to sign on the dotted line. Most of the contract, however, is a
			much smaller font that is hard to read clearly. The fine print changes and distorts anytime Maddie looks
			away or blinks.
		<p>
			“Whatever... My business is that clients can sign my contracts and I then will help them achieve their
			goals. Sign, 'Child'.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie carefully peers at the page, reading the fine print. It's unclear whether she's even noticed that the
			text is shifting, and even if she has, it doesn't seem to bother her. After finishing reading over it, she
			nods at the woman, and simply signs "Maddie" at the bottom.
		<p>
			"Yeah, that looks about right. My headpat now, if you will?"
		<p>
			Maddie's tail wags with anticipation as she hands the parchment back to the woman, seemingly undisturbed by
			the contents of the fine print.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania crumbles the contract up into a ball and throws it on the ground. She puts the pen in her purse,
			though. She keeps losing those things, so they're worth their weight in uranium isotopes.
		<p>
			“You really are an idiot, Maddie, for signing my contract after threatening me.”
		<p>
			She laughs, and she pets the cat girl on her head to the cat girl's perfect preference. It's the best head
			pat of all time, with even some scratches behind the ears... For a mortal, it'd be the start of a downward
			spiral, as the dark arcane forces of hell itself would make the mortal hopelessly obsessed with recapturing
			that fleeting, immaculate sensation and spend all their time and resources fruitlessly chasing it until
			their negligence renders them to a slow, inevitable death...

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie closes her eyes at the touch, calmly enjoying the pats. Her ears twitch at the scritches, and she
			even purrs softly as Mania's gentle touch hits all the right spots.
		<p>
			After the patting is finished, Maddie opens her eyes, and looks at Mania.
		<p>
			"Thank you for that. That was quite satisfying. You are pretty good at following through on your contracts!
			I might be interested in further dealings, that was enjoyable."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania frowns at Maddie's answer. She glances at the crumpled contract, and she stiffens up. She stands up
			and grabs Maddie again, only to shove her onto the floor, too. Mania's contracts have barely ever failed on
			a client before. There had to be a horrific reason for it this time.
		<p>
			“Aren't you going to beg me for more? Where's your damn enthusiasm?—What the hell are you? Just go fuck
			yourself!”
		<p>
			She storms off to the elevator in the lobby. As soon as she enters it, the wall and floor become this kind
			of cheap, stained, and red wallpaper and carpet. And she presses the elevator button to go down several
			times.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie gently pats the woman's head, the same way she had her own head patted moments ago. She's
			inexplicably standing in the elevator behind Mania, waiting for her to turn around after pressing the
			buttons.
		<p>
			"You really think you'd be able to avoid answering me that easily? Come on, I'm really not trying to cause
			that much trouble. I just wanted you to answer my questions. What are you? And what was up with me 'begging
			for more'? It was just a headpat. I like 'em, but they're not addicting or anything."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania grabs Maddie's arms and intends to rip them off despite not being the kind of demon particularly
			talented at ripping limbs off torsos.
		<p>
			The elevator doors close, and the elevator descends deeper and deeper. It's too humid and all too warm
			before long. And Mania jumps, and her feet land on the ceiling. She stands on the ceiling as if it is the
			floor, and it becomes clear why as soon as the elevator doors open again.
		<p>
			They've departed into the narrow hallway of an inverted office floor, complete with some accompanying
			inverted cubicles, furniture, and decorations.
		<p>
			A big, cracked glass window shows a mostly dark, rocky, and desolate place with warm magma pouring from the
			ceiling in places.
		<p>
			Mania pulls away from Maddie, staring at her as she walks backwards, on the ceiling, into a cubicle. Only
			the fax machine makes noise for a while.
		<p>
			“You've really given me no option, you asshole... I'm Mania. The CEO of Hell. Now it's your turn. Tell me
			what you are.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hm. Well, now that you've answered my questions, and I know what you are. I'll uphold what I said. I'm an
			angel."
		<p>
			As Maddie says this final word, her halo and wings reappear in a flash of golden light, and she floats up,
			not touching the floor or ceiling of the bizarre structure.
		<p>
			"I'm here to meet you, because you're the one who created me."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“That's... Impossible.”
		<p>
			A slurry of emotions pepper the demon, most of which have been absent for at least years. She rips the
			stapler from its glue on the desk and tosses it down at Maddie.
		<p>
			“You're lying! I'm a fucking demon, there are no angels for me! There never has been, never will be, you
			fucking liar. And the audacity to suggest I've somehow made you—gave creation to you, made you real?”
		<p>
			She screams out at her, and she throws her purse at her too.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			The stapler harmlessly bounces off of Maddie, and she simply gives Mania a disappointed look. She realizes
			that Mania may be a bit of a challenge to save.
		<p>
			"Please, calm down. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to end your eternal torment. It's not going to end
			today. Or this year. But I will save you, as is my duty. Don't you want to be free?"
		<p>
			Maddie gives her a pleading look, trying to reason with the panicked demon.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"Bullshit!" She continues. Her voice is this awful, rashy thing when it raises like this. "If you can free
			me, just do it already, bitch. Kill me once and for all or get out of my sight!"
		<p>
			A comically short demon peeks his head in from a neighboring cubicle, although his sense of gravity is the
			same as Maddie's and he seems confused and excited. Two more of these demons, very similar in their naked
			appearance, then also float in from a nearby hallway.
		<p>
			One says, "How the fuck is an angel here?" Another follows, "I thought those were dead too." And the last
			says, "I hear they explode into guts if they stay here too long!"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie is momentarily distracted by the arrival of the imps, and her eyes light up.
		<p>
			"Oh my god if you aren't the most adorable little hellspawn I've ever seen!"
		<p>
			Maddie turns to Mania, her head tilted.
		<p>
			"You didn't tell me your employees were this cute! I'm going to have to come down here more often. Also
			because helping you feels like it will be... a long process."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"Imps, grab her and escort her back into the elevator. You're all ugly. Don't listen to her. She's very
			foolish. Frankly, she's ugly too."
		<p>
			She frowns and steps away from the cubicle. She stares into the angel's eyes with incredible
			disgust—admittedly not for her appearance, though, but for what she claims to stand for.
		<p>
			The imps make an embarrassing effort even after some others join in trying to shove Maddie away, so Mania
			resorts to simply entering a door labeled with "CEO of Hell" on a plaque.
		<p>
			An imp says, "I dunno, I used to shoplift a hell of a lot. I don't think I'd be here if that was cute!"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie closes her eyes and breathes deeply, ignoring the imps for a moment. When she finishes, she scribbles
			something down on a piece of paper, then looks down at the imp.
		<p>
			"Oh nooo, I must run and leave now or these terrifying imps will destroy me!"
		<p>
			Feigning terror, she walks back to the elevator, giggling as she walks away. She boards the elevator,
			presses a button, and then waves goodbye to the imps as the door slides shut.
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			A train pulls back into Heaven, and Maddie steps off into the station. She begins walking towards the
			section of Heaven where some of the oldest angels reside, intent on figuring out how to save Mania.

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			The residential area of Heaven is intricate, beautiful, and yet efficient. More colors are prominently
			featured here in the flowers, trees, and outside paintings than most the rest of this afterlife. And gentle
			tramways exist just outside the unique exteriors of all the homes. No two homes look the same.
		<p>
			Eventually, Maddie arrives at a home featuring vivid orange flower arrangements in its front garden. And
			Maddie rings the doorbell to find a tall, hardy angel with glasses. Of course, they must be cosmetic.
		<p>
			He says, “Hello! Therein is our favorite feline angel!”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie smiles, happy to see her old friend and mentor. She walks up, arms wide for a hug.
		<p>
			"Hello Theo! It's great to see you again!"
		<p>
			She moves up, hugs the taller angel in greeting, and then follows him inside. Inside the house, down a
			hallway, they enter a comfortable living room with a couch next to a low table. Large door windows on the
			opposite side lead to a porch with a view of a beautiful garden.

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			One wall prominently displays a large shield and set of wooden instruments. On another is a mural of the
			Pantheon. He offers Maddie a drink with water, honey, and barley. He then nods.
		<p>
			“It's been a great many years. Thou here to spake with an old man?” He raises his eyebrows. “What's taken
			ahold of your mind?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie sits at the table, taking a sip of the drink. She takes a moment to think, then speaks.
		<p>
			"Yes, actually. Just today I met my Assumer for the first time. She was... not what I had expected. She's a
			demon, and she's so filled with hatred for herself and everyone in the world. I want to help her... do you
			know anything about this? I don't want her to suffer forever..."

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			He nods again. His eyes wander to the locked bedroom door. “It is not uncommon, Maddie—since of a truth it
			is far better to return for the souls of the Damned than abandon hope for them too. Every angel prepares for
			any mission of salvation.”
		<p>
			He walks to the room and knocks the door. A smiling human soul walks out holding a hardback book. It's a
			mystery novel.
		<p>
			“Maddie, draw thy eyes to Brian. He is my Assumer. I casted him from Hell.”
		<p>
			“I heard you were talking about demons?” Brian says.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie turns to look at Brian, ears perking up.
		<p>
			"Yes, I am asking about demons! My Assumer is one, and I really want to help her. Theo just said he took you
			from hell... I never knew that. Could you help me with this?
		<p>
			Maddie looks at Brian, pleading like a kitten begging for attention. Her tail waves expectantly.
		<p>
			"Her name is Mania, she claims to be the 'CEO of Hell.' Do you know what any of that means?"

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			Brian drops his book and coughs. “M-Mania? They cutting this kid some slack or what?” He laughs. “Of course
			I can help you, Maddie. From what I hear on Saturdays with the other Salvaged, Mania is basically a
			celebrity to the other human souls in Hell. She has twisted powers over mortals few human souls ever get.
			And she's your Assumer?”
		<p>
			Brian reaches for Theo's hand. He searches his eyes.
		<p>
			Theo says, “All demons suffer lest an angel comes to their calling. Then, they are ready to rest or are
			denying this privilege from themselves. But even for the willing Damned—”
		<p>
			“It might take a little while. It took me a century.” He is unfazed with this revelation.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie looks at Brian, a resolve in her eyes.
		<p>
			"I'll do it, however long it takes. It's my duty. I can't just... let her suffer down there forever. And she
			continues to make living humans suffer, and eventually they go to hell for what she's made them do, and then
			they suffer... I have to make it stop. For everyone's sake. I don't care if it takes me a hundred, two
			hundred, three hundred years. It's worth it."
		<p>
			Maddie looks back and forth between Theo and Brian.
		<p>
			"Please, any help is invaluable. Anything you can do."

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			Brian and Theo nod in unison.
		<p>
			The angel says, “Our likenesses train for often decades, and in our places even centuries. You're
			preparedness is as great as it could be, favoritest feline angel. However, by my decree because of the
			extraordinary circumstances of your assumer...”
		<p>
			He digs into a drawer under an urn beside them. He removes a vial of white, faintly glowing liquid from it
			along with a quill.
		<p>
			Brian smiles. “You're a genius, my Savior. That, Maddie, is holy ink remover—I think on Earth they would
			call it 'holy whiteout.' Are you picking up what Theo is putting down?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yes, this is perfect! I can completely ruin her contracts using this, and help the people she's trying to
			torment! If I can intercept her when she's handing someone the contract to sign, I can remove the fine print
			that ruins their lives."
		<p>
			Maddie takes the vial, slipping it into her purse, which phases in and out of physicality when she needs it.
		<p>
			"Thank you so much for this. I really want to save her. She doesn't deserve this."

	</div>
	<div class="Generic_w">
		<p>
			“No, no Assumer does.” Theo smiles. “Is there another thing else you need from this old man?”
		<p>
			Brian says, “You'll be legendary after all this is done and through, Maddie. I hope you know that. You're
			right that you'll be helping not just Mania but also prevent the suffering she causes. It's just invaluable
			work.”
		<p>
			He smiles and goes into the doorframe of his bedroom.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"No, that's all! Thank you so much for the help, this will be very impactful at bringing her salvation. I'm
			going to leave now, I'm going to see if I can catch her writing a contract and stop her."
		<p>
			Maddie waves goodbye as she walks away from the house and makes her way back to the train station. The train
			always takes Angels exactly where they need to be, so she simply boards it and sits down, looking out the
			window. She gazes through the ether, seeing endless clouds on an infinite sky as the train chugs along
			through the expanse between Heaven and Earth. Finally, her stop has arrived. She steps off the train,
			somewhere in rural Washington. She sees a farmhouse, and a familiar woman ringing the doorbell.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She greets the young farmer and steps inside with him. He closes the door, and a tattered sign swinging from
			the handle reads “Home Sweet Home.”
		<p>
			“Thank you for taking my call and appointment. It's such an honor. Sit anywhere you like, Ms. Flecheloo.” He
			opens his fridge and takes out a diet beer can.
		<p>
			“It won't be necessary,” She says. She takes a granny smith apple from the long dining table. “Glad you've
			found time to be alone for this, truly. Anyway, you said you wanted your kids to have access to better
			healthcare and services? You should be aware I'm much more capable than that. I could fund their educations.
			I could buy you a Ferrari, or whatever other damn thing.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie hides her wings and halo and then strides up and walks through the door. She simply stands behind
			Mania, out of her vision, waiting for her to write a contract. She makes eye contact with the now confused
			farmer and simply smiles and gives him a small wave, although her eyes glow golden for a brief moment. She
			waits patiently behind Mania, not making any further movements, content to wait for the right opportunity to
			step in.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			The man is placated by the angel's golden eyes, and he returns his attention to the CEO. He sips on his can.
		<p>
			"Actually, Miss, I'll take you up on that offer. My kids deserve a good education to go with their good
			insurance. And I don't need a new car or anything, but Penny should get that big ol' dollhouse she's been
			asking for!"
		<p>
			Mania nods, writing onto the same parchment from her black office binder that she used for Maddie's
			contractual headpat. She spreads the sheet and pen onto the table. And she then pokes her white painted
			nails together.
		<p>
			"They will have everything they could need, Mr. Richardson. I'm short on time, so read and sign on the
			dotted line—nice doing business."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie quietly pulls the faintly glowing bottle from her purse, uncorking it shortly after. She closes her
			eyes, and a thin trail of droplets, barely enough to make a dent in the contents of the flask, flows out,
			levitating through the air. The drops flow through the air and land onto the parchment. They cover the
			shifting, deceitful sections of the contract, leaving only the parts that are truly beneficial to the man.
		<p>
			Maddie opens her eyes, giving a small nod to the man, who is still somewhat under the effects of Maddie's
			angelic powers. He looks over the contract, quickly signing it. Where the white fluid landed, there is
			simply blank parchment, not a trace left behind of ink nor whiteout.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"Excellent. People would reward you for a job well done with your quaint wheat fields and your family, Mr.
			Richardson, but I'm not fucking people. I'm Mania, the CEO of Hell. Your good nature is a hindrance to your
			potential. Your time with your kids is ruining your chances at upscaling your business. You could be an
			agricultural fucking—"
		<p>
			Mania then suddenly screams, and she digs in her purse for something she prepared just in case Maddie
			decided to show up again. And her red skin and demonic horns and tail override her human disguise. She
			tumbles onto the ceiling.
		<p>
			"Leave me alone, you stupid bitch. Why are you here?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Let's take this outside, please. Shouldn't it be obvious why I'm here? I'm stopping you from terrorizing
			this poor man. Come on, we can talk this out outside."
		<p>
			Maddie turns to the man as her halo and wings reappear.
		<p>
			"Go now, child. Enjoy the benefits of the contract, and know that I have kept you safe. Your intentions were
			pure, and thus you were saved. Leave the room, and speak of this to no one."
		<p>
			Maddie picks up the contract, and it shimmers into golden light, sealed. Mania is now contractually
			obligated to help the farmer, as per the contract's writing.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			The farmer's brief venture into abject terror and bewilderment is resolved by Maddie's holy proclamations,
			and he walks away with a warm feeling. He downs the rest of his beer can and tosses it down the stairwell.
		<p>
			Mania sits on the ceiling with her legs crossed, her hand still dug in her purse. She threw her temper
			tantrum and then some, bickering now under her breath. Eventually, however, she stops and smiles.
		<p>
			"Alright, Maddie, I've finally come to realize the error of my ways. Give me a hug. I'll show you."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie gives Mania a disappointed look and then rolls her eyes.
		<p>
			"Sure you have. You definitely are well meaning and want a genuine hug."
		<p>
			Maddie gracefully floats up to the ceiling, flipping upside down to match Mania. However, she lands behind
			Mania and gives her a hug from behind, gently but very obviously locking Mania's arms from moving during the
			hug.
		<p>
			"This isn't so bad, right?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			The demon struggles in her restraints, groaning. Her arm repeatedly tries to lift itself from the purse,
			holding an enchanted dagger inside.
		<p>
			"You're lucky you didn't scare my client away. I'll make his life even more of a living Hell just for you!
			Let go of me! Do you really think you mean anything to me? Of course I don't really want a damn hug."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			A golden light shines from Maddie's halo, and the two of them find themselves in the farmer's field, a fair
			distance away from the house, on a small path through the crops.
		<p>
			"Come on now. You know that won't work on me," Maddie says, arms out, exposing her body for Mania to stab,
			"Although you can try if you like. Can't we just have a chat? Do you really want to keep hurting yourself?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania returns to standing on the mortal ground, then, briefly impressed by the arbitrary teleportation. The
			wheat is just a week away before harvest.
		<p>
			“I didn't know angels actually exist, assuming you're really an angel, so I'm looking forward to stabbing
			the shit out of you and testing that theory, alright? If you're so immortal, you have nothing to fear!”
		<p>
			She drags the knife from her purse and stabs it through Maddie's shirt and where the heart would be. A
			coating of a demon's ichor on the tip of the blade stings the angel and nothing more, neutralizing inside
			the angel's form. And Mania then stabs her two more times before dropping the knife on the dirt.
		<p>
			“So you aren't just a catty sorceress,” She says. “Dammit.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Why would I lie to you about being an angel? I really do just want to help you, Mania. You really do have
			nothing to lose except your pain."
		<p>
			Maddie walks up to her again, this time giving her a genuine hug. She quietly speaks into the demon's ear.
		<p>
			"You could be free. You could join everyone else in heaven, spend the rest of eternity happy and without
			torment. Why do you resist like this, all you need to do is let go of your hatred and pain. It may take a
			while, years, decades, centuries. But your suffering can end."
		<p>
			She simply stays like this, holding the other woman in a soft embrace.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She slaps Maddie's arms away, and she jogs in a random direction—away.
		<p>
			Mania says, "I have a skyscraper! I have unimaginable wealth. I have incredible power over the lives of
			other. I can fuck anyone or anything I want. I chose this afterlife. What do you have? Little wings? You can
			kiss wounds? You have to speak like you're talking to my frail old grandma, so fucking pedantic?"
		<p>
			She laughs. She combs her white hair back with her hands.
		<p>
			"Stop wasting your time, Maddie. Why do you care about me? How could I ever have created someone so
			obnoxiously obsessed with my fate? What was that about?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie, still being patient with the annoying demon, rolls her eyes.
		<p>
			"Fine. I'll drop the voice thing. You don't have a skyscraper and unimaginable wealth. You have a prison
			cell and Monopoly money. None of it actually does anything for you. Your mind is just so clouded with pain
			that you don't realize it. Or maybe you do realize it, and you're just trying to convince yourself
			otherwise, because you're scared."
		<p>
			Maddie gives her a genuinely sad look.
		<p>
			"You are literally the reason I exist, and I have to care for you. It's simply a part of my being."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I'm a demon in Hell—of course there's some caveats. I can't fuck with the big man, I can't hire much better
			than those worthless imps, I can't see anything from my office other than magma and rock! But I'm powerful.
			I'm unstoppable. I'm a damn menace. I'm worth the planet in gold!”
		<p>
			She shrugs. She digs into her purse for her cellphone, and she checks for signal.
		<p>
			“If you have to care for me so much, how about you send me to my office after you tell me why I don't
			remember creating you?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well, angels are beings created unintentionally by humans. Whenever a human tries to remember someone that
			never existed, an angel is born. I happen to have appeared near the end of your life, when you were insane.
			You mourned the loss of a cat that never really existed, and from that, I was born in heaven. I chose this
			form," She gestures to her ears, "in honor of that."
		<p>
			She gives Mania a hopeful look.
		<p>
			"So, now that I've told you how you created me, will you listen to me? Sure, we can go back to your office
			in Hell. I can fix your air conditioner if you want me to by the way."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			A genuine confusion crosses Mania. She stops walking away.
		<p>
			“Why would that create anything, let alone a whole-ass angel? It's creative, if nothing else. And I didn't
			imagine anything, and I'm not insane—they figured that out real quick, and then they hung me by the damn
			neck! I wanted something more than anyone, and I guess that was too much for them. I'd hate to waste my life
			away in poverty like the rest of you losers.”
		<p>
			She continues, frustrated with the cellphone and stuffing it away again, “Seriously, though, are you
			implying little kitty Ana didn't exist?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie spreads her arms wide. "I'm pretty much the closest thing to your pet cat that's ever existed."
		<p>
			Maddie walks closer to Mania and then takes her hand. Without asking, a golden light once again flows from
			Maddie's halo, and they find themselves back in Mania's office.
		<p>
			"So, could you point me to the air conditioning unit? I can probably fix it."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania frowns. She leans on the wall in the stuffy hallway and grinds on her teeth. She's returned to the
			ceiling, and she points at the busted air conditioning unit.
		<p>
			"Angel or not, you're not going to fix the air conditioner. Don't waste our damn time. And show me where I
			can unsubscribe from you ever showing your ugly face again. Like, I want to speak to your manager. I don't
			need you. I'm happy, idiot. There's nothing else you should care about."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie walks over to the air conditioning unit, looking closely at it. She opens a panel on the side,
			viewing the inner workings. Reaching into her purse, which manifests on her side, she begins pulling out
			screwdrivers and wrenches and other tools. She then pulls out a welding mask, an entire propane tank, and a
			blowtorch. She doesn't use the propane tank, but she still has it just in case the blowtorch runs out. She
			begins working on the air conditioner, fixing it rapidly. Within ten minutes, the air conditioner is working
			as if it is brand new.
		<p>
			Maddie lifts the welding mask. "There you go! Oh come on, I'm not that ugly am I? I thought you liked cats.
			And, uh, you'd have to go to Heaven to speak to my manager. And they're an Archangel so they probably won't
			like you very much. Actually, I could bring you to heaven for a day trip! I can show you around a little,
			give you a taste of where you'll be once you're out of hell."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania watches Maddie's purse drained out with an entire mechanic's workshop, and then she shrugs and walks
			away. She checks her emails on her yellowing PC and occasionally glances back over at Maddie.
		<p>
			The noise of the max setting of the air conditioner is about as thrilling to Mania as an ice cream truck
			jingle is for a pudgy kid in the 20s. She's already over Maddie's shoulder, ignoring her voice entirely in
			favor of awkwardly waving her hands in front of the machine, the cool air entirely out of place in this
			infernal place.
		<p>
			“How did you do this? I kidnapped dozens of mechanics here... I've hired NASA engineers!”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Hm. You must not have kidnapped any competent engineers, because it was really easy. Just needed to screw
			in a few loose panels and clear the hellfire out of it. Oh. Right. Humans can't purge the hellfire that
			somehow got stuck inside of your ACU; that's probably the issue."
		<p>
			Maddie sits on an office chair, spinning it to face Mania.
		<p>
			"So what now. Are you willing to listen to me? You feel that wonderful, cool breeze from the air
			conditioning? You can feel nice and comfortable like that all the time in heaven. Never have to worry about
			it breaking down again."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She lays in front of the air conditioner, and her hair bounces in the manufactured breeze. She shakes her
			head.
		<p>
			“'Listen to you?' How about 'Are you ready to listen to me,' Maddie? If you're really some angel performing
			fucking black magic and fixing shit I should be suffering for, why should I need a heaven? Work for me, and
			I'll make it worth your time. You said your duty was to help me? Well, you're helping me, bitch. Get me a
			better computer, that shit hangs every couple of minutes. Fix my internet. The only reception I get is from
			fucking Bolivia. No idea why.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I, like most angels, am very patient. And I'm being very patient with you, right now. I can only
			temporarily fix these problems, they'll keep returning forever. And I'll have obligations elsewhere. So
			you're going to continue to suffer, eternally, until you let go."
		<p>
			Maddie kneels down on the floor next to Mania's head and then bends over and kisses her on the forehead.
		<p>
			"Haven't I shown you that I truly do mean to help you by now? Or will you make this difficult for yourself
			and take hundreds of years. It's really your choice, I'll wait as long as I have to. I'll keep coming back
			for you."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Let's try making this as difficult as possible and test your patience. You'll go away if you get sick of
			me. I can live with the stupid inconveniences if it means I get to be as cool as Hell. Anyway—”
		<p>
			Mania smashes Maddie's chin against the floor and grumbles, returning to the ceiling and walking over to the
			elevator.
		<p>
			“Please don't kiss me. What kind of angel kisses a demon, seriously? But seriously, I have a man in Toronto
			with a big dick waiting for me in four minutes, and you're really turning me off right now, and I really
			have to do this. The least you can let me have is this. Leave me alone for a fucking minute, okay?”
		<p>
			She presses the elevator button, and the elevator zips away.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			Several months have passed since Maddie first met Mania. Maddie gently picks up the soul of a young girl, no
			older than six. She's crying, still terrified of the flames that already consumed her body on the second
			floor of the burning building. Maddie gently consoles her, gently carrying her up to Heaven. So many die
			pointlessly, with no opportunity to live out their lives. But such is life, and Maddie does her job because
			somebody has to do it. She is left in heaven with her grandmother, who had died two years ago of natural
			causes. The grandmother, greatly saddened by her granddaughter's death, does have some level of happiness in
			being reunited with her. Maddie knows she will be happy here, as all citizens of Heaven are.
		<p>
			With a deep sigh, Maddie has finished her work for now. She boards a train and exits by an office building.
			Stepping inside, she goes into the elevator, which takes her down, down further than any elevator should go.
		<p>
			A "ding" plays, and the doors slide open. Maddie is greeted by a concerning sight; Mania is sprawled on the
			floor, breathing heavily. She's covered in bruises, with black ichor staining her clothes, still seeping
			from a gash on her forehead.
		<p>
			Maddie rushes to her side. "Are you alright? What happened?"
		<p>
			She takes a cloth from her purse, dampening it using a small water bottle. She wipes some of the blood off
			her face, carefully cleaning the cut. With a slight golden glow, she seals the cut, although the bruises do
			not fade.
		<p>
			"I would heal you more, but I'm afraid angelic healing power beyond that minor act will hurt a demon more
			than it would help one."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania says slowly, coughing up her demonic blood with her breaths, “Some losers didn't like my deal and
			decided to take revenge on me by summoning me and beating the shit out of me. I'm fine. Come on.”
		<p>
			She doesn't even shove the angel away, however. She doesn't even yell at her imps as they approach around
			Maddie and her. She simply groans and writhes slowly on the ground. One imp, an especially trouble-making
			girl, even floats beside the downed demon and kicks her knee. “Shows you!” She says. Whatever act sent her
			here must have been especially evil as Maddie has seen nobody quite as young as her among the imps in
			Mania's skyscraper.
		<p>
			“You've healed me enough. Uh, thanks, Maddie. But you'd help me a Hell of a lot more if you got me to the
			couch and gave me the remote.”
		<p>
			The last months have been especially chaotic. Maddie's continued involvement in neutralizing some of the
			contracts in the same way she neutralized the farmer's had forced Mania to be more secretive about just how
			many people she'd sign contracts with in a day. And, more than that, there was a period where Mania even
			refused to acknowledge the angel, giving her the silent treatment. But, no attempt to dissuade the desperate
			celestial went anywhere, so Mania conceded.
		<p>
			“I'll need to postpone my next several clients.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"You should try thinking about something other than your clients for once, Mania. You might find it
			relaxing."
		<p>
			Maddie partially lifts Mania, helping drag her to the couch. She sets her down there and then approaches the
			young imp. She sits on her haunches to get to eye level with her, looking at her curiously.
		<p>
			"What did you do to get down here, little one? Someone as young as you is rare in here."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I was jealous of my little brother so I, um, grabbed his neck really hard,” The little imp giggles. “It
			really upset my daddy. I didn't mean to make him mad.”
		<p>
			Mania ignores the imp, and she browses the listings on the television's streaming app. She's still groaning
			with pain.
		<p>
			“I have hobbies, smartass. The damn problem is that there's nothing interesting to watch.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie nods gently, looking the little imp in the eyes.
		<p>
			"I see what happened. You killed your little brother. Maybe you meant it, maybe you didn't. But do you
			realize what making someone die does? When they die, they're gone. They don't come back. That's why your
			father sent you down here. He killed you too, like what you did to your brother. It's not very nice down
			here, though."
		<p>
			Maddie puts a hand on her chin, pretending to think deeply.
		<p>
			"Maybe if you recognize what you did was wrong, you'll get to leave. You'll even get to see your little
			brother again, and apologize to him, I might be able to take you there."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania eventually settles on some new drama serial to stare at. It's a blessing to her that this imp is
			interesting enough for Maddie to be distracted by it.
		<p>
			The imp shrugs and shares a cute smile. “I meant it, but I guessssssss I didn't think my brother would be
			gone gone. Gone gone. Gone gone gone gone gone.”
		<p>
			She eventually continues, “Mania makes me work a lot. I lick so many envelopes... I hate it here! Can I
			leave? So if dying is like that, what do I do if I feel really mad at my brother? I don't think I want to
			see him...”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well, if killing is so bad, think of alternative ways to get back at your brother. You could have
			complained to your mom, and she may have helped. Anything else, except killing him, really. If you were that
			mad at him, you could've broken one of his toys. It wouldn't have been the right thing to do, but it would
			have been far better than killing him."
		<p>
			Maddie sighs, trying to figure out how to word her next statement to the imp.
		<p>
			"I think you don't hate your little brother as much as you say. I think you should really go up and
			apologize to him; it would be a good lesson on how to treat other people."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I guess so... Like I did complain and I did do other stuff but—but I guess I didn't break his toys before I
			killed him. I didn't think to! I would have if I knew my daddy would send me here.”
		<p>
			She giggles again. The imp starts to float closer to the ground. Her skin is a shade less red.
		<p>
			“Well... umm, I could try, but what if I kill him again when I didn't mean to? And then I do it again? I
			might mess up a lot... Oh, and and and—what if I still don't like him?”
		<p>
			“Can you keep it down?” Mania says.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well... that's the thing with killing someone. You can only really do it once. And then they're gone. But
			you'll see your brother again; I'll take you to him. It's a special place called Heaven, and you'll never
			have to work again. You can just play and relax, and who knows, maybe you'll learn to be friends with your
			brother."
		<p>
			Maddie ruffles her hair a little bit, giving her a smile.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Okay! If I can't mess up again I guess... I guess I can go see Noah. Does he have toys in heaven, just in
			case I get mad? Take me to see him! I want to go. Please? Please? Pretty please?”
		<p>
			The imp smiles and hugs Maddie. Her feet are on the ground now, and she's been sucked of her red color.
		<p>
			“Um, but only if I get to stay. Like forever forever. I want to play again.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie chuckles, taking the girl's hand.
		<p>
			"I promise. Forever forever. I'll take you there!" Maddie's halo flashes, and the two of them are on a quiet
			street in Heaven. They walk past rows of beautiful houses, until they reach a pleasant light blue house with
			a gray shingled roof. She leads her to the door, ringing the doorbell. Moments later, a young boy opens the
			door.
		<p>
			"Eleanor? But why are you here... the angels said you probably wouldn't be here for a long time..."
		<p>
			Tears welling in his eyes, he runs out the door, hugging his sister. Maddie simply smiles and then turns
			around, leaving the little scene behind. She still has her work cut out for her. Returning down to Mania's
			offices via the train and elevator, she steps back in to see Mania still at the TV.
		<p>
			"Sorry about that. I'll hang out with you now."
		<p>
			She plops herself on the couch next to Mania, not bothering to ask her first. She knows the demon would say
			no if she did, anyways.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“You really shouldn't hang out with me,” Mania says. “What the fuck ever, though. We're on episode two, but
			you didn't miss much... Mind telling me where you took that imp you stole? Demons like her are supposed to
			be in Hell, obviously, so you're kind of violating the supernatural law. But oh I know, you're just trying
			to be such a good little angel. You're going to tell me you saw potential or whatever. Well, I'm here to
			tell you that Hell is supposed to last forever. Didn't you like fucking read that somewhere?”
		<p>
			She sighs, staring at the television as it buffers for a few seconds.
		<p>
			“I guess you think it doesn't last forever since you're delusional enough to think I can go to heaven.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, the girl? She's not an imp anymore. I chatted with her a bit, and it turns out all she had to do was
			let go of the resentment for her little brother. Once she did that, it was easy for her to pass on. I took
			her up to heaven, she's in a house with her brother now. The one she killed in life."
		<p>
			Maddie watches the show with Mania, enjoying simply hanging out.
		<p>
			"And no, human souls aren't supposed to be here forever. The greater demons, who were never human in the
			first place, stay forever. They're more like a part of hell itself. They spread propaganda telling the souls
			here that the torment is eternal, because the suffering is much greater when there's seemingly no end. Every
			human soul down here does pass on, eventually."
		<p>
			Maddie notices the TV buffer.
		<p>
			"Did the TV service break down again? Could've sworn I fixed it just a few weeks ago."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"How did you figure that out? Nobody told me they were fucking lying about the rules of Hell. Are you
			serious? That can't be right. I want to be here, I'm not even close to done being this rich, powerful bitch.
			I never will be. What I want is to become one of those higher ups here. Hell, I could overtake the big man
			himself. Then I could rule and avoid all my stupid suffering."
		<p>
			She frowns though, obviously affected. She turns the volume up on the television, apparently ignoring the
			buffering.
		<p>
			"Anyway, I can get more imps where she came from. Whatever. I need someone else to lick my envelopes.
			Someone less childish..."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie lies down, putting her head on Mania's lap. She's remarkably catlike in this moment.
		<p>
			"Is that really what you want, Mania? You keep saying that but you seem really unhappy all the time. You
			never stop complaining, you just sound miserable. Wouldn't it be nice to have a giant mansion in Heaven,
			functioning appliances, like a working TV?"
		<p>
			She stares at the buffering TV, almost as bored as Mania.
		<p>
			"It's all just a giant lie. A giant lie to keep you miserable, because you made people miserable in life.
			But once you've finished your sentence, you can just leave. The only thing is that you have to be willing to
			leave."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania groans with how close Maddie has presented herself to the demon.
		<p>
			“Well, I'm telling you what I damn want—think it stands to reason I'm not fucking kidding. If I became a
			pasty little angel I wouldn't be even a tenth of the incredible woman I am. I don't want a normal life. I
			like this one, even with all the fucking little annoyances coloring my day. Can you stop asking me to go to
			heaven? I'm not willing to leave, so I'm never going to leave, okay? Is it a lie if I don't really care what
			we're watching, and I'm just waiting to heal enough to go back to writing my magical contracts?”
		<p>
			She touches her own forehead.
		<p>
			“Anyway, let's change the subject. If you're not leaving me alone, you pathetic worm, I have something else
			to complain to you about.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"You won't become an angel. You'll just stop being a demon. You'll be a bit like you were in life. You're
			quite beautiful, you know."
		<p>
			She snuggles up, getting comfy in Mania's lap.
		<p>
			"Tell me, how exactly did you get where you are? Did you work hard to reach this point? You seem to be so
			attached to it; you aren't willing to let go yet."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“That was a really long time ago. I'm not interested.”
		<p>
			She clacks her nails together. The show stops buffering for now, thankfully.
		<p>
			“I know I'm sexy. Yes, though, I worked my ass off. I still do. For the longest time I had to conduct market
			research in Hell with even less than I have now, and it went nowhere, but eventually I got my foot in the
			damn door. I got this location, I got imps, I executed my strategy with my new assets and abilities. Hell I
			even got recognized by the Internal Revenue Service. Fucking caspers.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"But it everything is so perfect for you down here... why do you seem so miserable? I haven't seen you happy
			at all. You just complain and groan and suffer. I think you act like you have it all because you can't come
			to terms with the fact that you're in Hell, suffering forever."
		<p>
			She rotates in Mania's lap, looking up at her.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She rolls her eyes.
		<p>
			“...To return to what I was going to tell you, the state of my eternal damnation was my choice. The creation
			of this office building also was the start of me having to be on the damn ceiling all the time. If I resist
			it for too long I get splitting headaches. The Demons of Fate really thought they were fucking funny with
			that one. But one of those bastards personally explained to me, actually, that I'd become insatiably horny
			as well when I started writing mortals contracts. I'm only a whore as some stupid, ironic payment.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie is silent for a moment, thinking over Mania's words.
		<p>
			"Well... I'm supposed to be helping you. If you want me to I could... you know... help you? With the
			insatiable horniness?"
		<p>
			She blushes as she barely manages to force the words out, her face almost as red as Mania's.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania slaps Maddie's face and then pushes her off her lap. She groans again in pain, so she hugs her arms
			against her chest.
		<p>
			“Horny idiot. I'd rather fuck that crypto bro again.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie blushes even deeper, flustered at Mania's insult. She rubs her cheek, which stings slightly at
			Mania's slap.
		<p>
			"I'm not horny! I was just offering to help... it's my obligation to help you... I'm sorry."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			Maria clicks the laser pointer on and points at the presentation software projected onto the wall of the
			tech company's boardroom.
		<p>
			“Thank you for hosting me today. As CEO of Ulterior Inc., I hope to enrich Impressions Corporation with
			exciting opportunities!”
		<p>
			She circles the laser point dot on a clip art of a man giving a thumbs up. She scheduled this meeting, like
			many of her meetings, in secrecy from Maddie. And she found through the last few years that wearing unique,
			enchanted perfumes would make it nearly impossible for the angel to track her down.
		<p>
			“It's common knowledge to the public that their information is being bought by 'shadow companies'. But what
			if the consumers could take back their information rights? What if it was in the palms of their hands?”
		<p>
			One of the men in suits murmurs.
		<p>
			“Right. Introducing InfoShare!” The slide changes to a logo with one color and a vague shape. “Using
			InfoShare, anyone can willingly concede their data to the highest bidder! And you, at Impressions
			Corporation, would get it all for free too.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			The door in the back of the boardroom quietly opens, and a woman in a suit, dressed like the other people in
			the room, slips in. A pair of cat ears protrudes from the top of her hair. She simply follows suit with the
			other businesspeople, watching the presentation intently.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Maria shares a piercing stare to the angel in the suit, and she continues anyway.
		<p>
			“InfoShare is a free app. The wider of a net the app casts, the larger the amount of aggregate data we can
			sell to the very 'shadow companies' consumers were hoping to avoid altogether! So, please, together we can
			remove any last semblance of dignity from a citizen of the free market. Selling your labor and time for
			forty-hour workweeks was the first great innovation, and then came selling your body on social media
			services—which is still a growing practice. And now you sell your unique digital footprint!”
		<p>
			She claps her hands in self-applause. Most of the room joins Maria in this.
		<p>
			“Any questions? Please remember I have more innovations to discuss today, and we don't have all day.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie walks over to Mania, grabbing her hand and shaking it.
		<p>
			"Excellent work, just a great proposal. You forgot your ichorfume, by the way. I could sense you
			immediately. Let's get to the elevator."
		<p>
			Without waiting for Mania to answer, she drags her out the door with a surprising strength. She brings her
			to the elevator, pulling her into it with her.
		<p>
			"Okay, you need to put in the address for 254 Celestine Ave, 29th floor. Trust me, it'll be great. And put
			on your ichorfume, you're going to need it."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania grumbles and tosses copies of her business card across the floor and hallway as she's dragged out of
			the board room.
		<p>
			“Thank you!” She says to the executives. When the elevator closes, however, she addresses Maddie. She also
			applies her demonic perfume.
		<p>
			“Dammit. Oh well. Since we're here, I guess I'll humor you. Is it going to be another dying kid you're
			taking me to pity or whatever? You know I don't really care. Why do I need this shit sprayed on?”
		<p>
			She presses the elevator button with the address in mind. And when the red room zooms away, an echo booms
			below them, and the lights briefly flicker. Mania raises her eyebrow at Maddie.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie steps out the elevator door, noticing a familiar hallway. It's not too long of a corridor, and the
			end of it is a large floor to ceiling window, which looks out on a shining white and gold city. Maddie leads
			Mania to door 2905, pushing it open and leading Mania inside. It opens into a large suite; the main room has
			a large couch with a coffee table and a TV on the wall. There's a corridor leading to a kitchen and two
			doors, which are likely to be a bathroom and bedroom. A large window spans the right wall, again looking out
			over the city.
		<p>
			"Welcome to my apartment! I hope you like it. We're in Heaven right now."
		<p>
			Maddie turns, beaming at Mania as she shows her the apartment.
		<p>
			"So? What do you think? Wanna sit on the couch with me?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania, still in her human disguise, lingers outside of the angel's apartment, staring out of the window at
			the pristine city. She's quiet, bizarrely so, and she zips up her purse.
		<p>
			She then slips inside the apartment, and she runs her hands on the fabric of the couch. She smirks at the
			rest of the place, and she goes ahead and lies across the couch.
		<p>
			“There's no way I'm supposed to be in Heaven right now. Pretty sure we'd both get in a lot of fucking
			trouble if we got caught. Sure is beautiful here, though. So much infrastructure just outside the windows...
			I thought it would be some boring grassy field or something. Guess that was a damn lie, too. Anyway, why the
			Hell do you drink coffee? That caffeine shouldn't work on you.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh? I don't drink the coffee. Stuff's nasty. But my cat, Virtue, loves it. Hold on."
		<p>
			Maddie turns toward the door that leads to her bedroom, and goes "Pspspspspsps," calling her cat. A cat
			slowly walks out, plump and fluffy, and walks over to Maddie, who scoops it up.
		<p>
			"He loves coffee. Not sure why, not going to question it, but I'm fairly sure the way he died was eating an
			entire bag of coffee beans in life. And I just take care of him. Angels often adopt stray pets that die with
			no one to go to."
		<p>
			Maddie glances at Mania, noticing her demonic aura.
		<p>
			"Oh goodness. You really need to put on that concealing mixture before someone notices you. I'll help, if
			you like."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“You named your cat Virtue?” She laughs. “Your kind is absolutely fucking insufferable. I had no idea cats
			and stuff could go to the afterlife at all. They sure aren't in Hell. I guess that means they're all devoid
			of sin.”
		<p>
			She shrugs. Maddie's couch is somehow the most comfortable couch she's ever sprawled across, and that would
			include hundreds. They've only improved with the centuries, a pleasant side-effect of capitalism being
			commercial innovation, but Maddie's is immaculate in the way things in Heaven are.
		<p>
			“Concealing what? What does that do, make me invisible or something?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Basically, you reek of demonic energy. You don't actually smell, but you have an aura about you that
			instantly makes you recognizable as a demon to any angel who sees you. Which is uh. Not good for what we're
			doing right now."
		<p>
			Maddie sits on the couch, next to Mania.
		<p>
			"Of course cats are devoid of sin. 'They're driven by instinct and do not have morality as humans do' is
			what a lesser person would say. I just know that all cats are awesome and good." She wiggles her ears for
			added effect.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Right. It sounds like you want to spray me with the angel equivalent of my ichorfume, did I get that right?
			Are you sure it won't hurt like a bitch? I'm pretty sure that shit's going to hurt.”
		<p>
			She looks up at Maddie, still incredibly pleased by this wild circumstance. Mania has rarely verged on
			getting into genuine trouble. It's thrilling. The last time was when Mania tried to be a smartass with one
			of her contracts by inserting a clause in invisible print that she would be freed from Hell altogether. The
			Demons of Fate intervened before it was even signed. What followed was just terrible.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yeah, you'll be okay, I'm sure! Let me grab the cream from my room!"
		<p>
			Maddie gets up for a moment, leaving Mania with Virtue. The cat stares at her, then meows once, and curls up
			next to her. Maddie returns, holding a tube of a glistening golden substance.
		<p>
			"Oh. Right. It's like a lotiony cream thingy. You're going to need to take some of your clothes off... sorry
			about that. Want me to help you with that?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania pets Virtue a single time while Maddie is in her bedroom.
		<p>
			Upon her return, the demon rolls her eyes and strips off her formal clothes from the board meeting, tossing
			them on the floor. She's left in what seems to resemble shiny red lingerie but is actually just Mania's
			standard 'comfy clothing'. It isn't close to the first time Maddie has seen it.
		<p>
			“Will that suffice, Maddie? I'll be fucking naked if I need to.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Yes, that's probably enough. Not that I would mind having you naked in my apartment. Just hold still."
		<p>
			Maddie begins to rub her down with the cream, which seems to slowly absorb into her skin. She coats her
			entire body in it, leaving no spots missing. She moves carefully and slowly around Mania's breasts, her
			low-cut lingerie revealing a lot of chest for Maddie to coat.
		<p>
			"Sorry if that was a bit... awkward. You're going to need to sit like this for a bit while it absorbs into
			your body. Give it a few minutes."
		<p>
			Maddie sits on the couch and then curls up next to Virtue, looking for all the world like another cat
			sitting next to it.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“You're not funny, Maddie. If you ever see my nipples, you'll have to fucking pay me. Cash.”
		<p>
			She keeps still, though, and she lets the angel caress the lotion all over her fiery skin. She sometimes
			shivers, however, and then clenches her teeth.
		<p>
			As they wait for it to dry, she says, “I feel like I have ice burns everywhere. They definitely didn't think
			to design this shit for demons. You'd think they'd have thought of fucking everything here.”
		<p>
			Mania's passive demonic aura, however, does gradually smear and hide under the overwhelming power of the
			holy cream. Her eyes widen, and she touches her own arm. She sniffs it.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"You look a lot nicer. Your skin should look less demonic once it finishes setting in. Then we can go
			outside and you can see the city! It'll be great, you'll love it. Also, put on something more casual once
			the cream has set in."
		<p>
			Maddie walks over to the large window, smiling as she looks out over the city. Angels fly back and forth,
			and a mingling crowd of souls and angels constantly are walking around the streets of the city, going about
			their day.
		<p>
			"You know, I really think you'll come to like it here. It'll be your home someday, you know."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Yeah, this feels really weird. It sort of feels like being human, but that's been ages so what do I know.
			What do you mean I look nicer?”
		<p>
			She shakes her head and then closes her eyes and enjoys this odd peace this cream has afforded her. It's
			alien. She doesn't even feel in a hurry.
		<p>
			Eventually, however, she grumbles and changes her human appearance with her usual quick magical touchup
			methods. And while it may not be a suit, it's still something expensive, formal, and dressy. It drapes her
			legs and hides her chest. And it's white, a mockery of the realm they're in. She wanders to Maddie at the
			view.
		<p>
			“I wouldn't be so sure. You're not just going to drug and bait who I am out of me. This is just a fun little
			distraction.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie steps towards the door, finished with admiring the view.
		<p>
			"Come with me, we're going to walk around the city a bit. Maybe I'll take you to my favorite café. We can
			get something nice to drink. Do you like croissants?"
		<p>
			Maddie's wings and halo are visible, denoting her as an Angel to all of Heaven. She pushes open the door,
			waiting for the disguised demon.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I don't really eat much, Maddie. It doesn't taste like anything to me anymore, and what's a little hunger
			to a fair amount of physical pain? I can barely even feel alcohol.”
		<p>
			She walks out of the apartment with her designated angel, then.
		<p>
			“Okay, but why do I feel like going to eat a croissant anyway? I definitely won't freaking taste it.
			Freaking. F—”
		<p>
			She shivers.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie chuckles.
		<p>
			"Oh yeah, no being naughty. The cream has a lot of side effects, you know."
		<p>
			Maddie steps into the elevator, making sure Mania follows her in. She sets it down to the first floor.
			Stepping out, she walks by the front desk, where a mechanical-looking angel is sipping a cup of coffee and
			reading some papers.
		<p>
			"Morning, Y'nara!" Maddie waves to the angel. They wave back, strange gears turning in their joints. The
			angel notably didn't react much to Mania, acting as if nothing was out of place. Maddie pushes open the
			front door, leading Mania out.
		<p>
			"The café is just a couple blocks down the street, you'll like it I swear."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She grumbles, and she hugs her shoulders as they walk out of the apartment building. The street is lively,
			of course, but also not crowded. The diversity of the individuals in the street baffles Mania—there are four
			classifications of demons who were once humans and then also the special, higher caste of the Demons of
			Fate. Here, seemingly every angel is as defined as Maddie and that robotic one.
		<p>
			“I better like that café. I'm kind of used to being naughty, remember? Even if I think that Y'nara looks
			cool. And the rest of this place, for that matter. It looks just so clean—I'm not coming back here ever
			again, even just because of this goody two-shoes crap. Ugh.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh come on, once you move here properly you'll be able to cuss like a sailor. It's just the temporary
			solution."
		<p>
			They continue to walk, eventually coming across a small café, with large windows in the front of the store.
			Maddie leads her in. It's cozy, cute, and positively heavenly. Maddie steps up to the barista, an angel
			whose entire body is one glowing, crystalline eyeball.
		<p>
			"Can I get the usual? And two of them, one for my friend."
		<p>
			The eye contorts into something that's about as close to a smile as an eye can do, and speaks. Clearly,
			Maddie is a regular.
		<p>
			"Of course! Nice to see a new face in here," the angel says, "Two Hot Chocolate Swirls coming right up!"
		<p>
			Maddie smiles and then leads Mania to a booth.
		<p>
			"That's Jeremy. He's a sweetheart. I don't know how an eyeball runs a cafe, but he makes do. Isn't it a nice
			place?"
		<p>
			There’s a couple other groups of angels and souls hanging out in the cafe, one or two of whom wave at
			Maddie. Maddie waves back, clearly recognizing them from around.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“You sure enjoy assuming that I'll actually live here someday. Didn't your mother teach you not to assume
			things of other people? Oh, well, I suppose you don't really have a mom.”
		<p>
			She stares at the eyeball with hesitation and disgust, and she exhales as she slides in their booth. She
			speaks quietly, fearful that she'll be caught in this sacred place and punished accordingly in Hell, really.
		<p>
			“I didn't want hot chocolate, speaking of assuming everything. You're wasting your money, or angel coins, or
			whatever. It's nice in here, yes. And, anyway, mind telling me why this Jeremy is an abomination? I thought
			people were supposed to enjoy this place. Did he stare through too many bathroom windows and receive
			punishment or something?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"I'm appalled that you'd call Jeremy an abomination! He runs the cafe in his spare time, he enjoys it a lot.
			Before he retired, he watched over souls as they entered heaven, to make sure everything was going smoothly.
			Hence the giant eye. I think he's pretty cute."
		<p>
			Maddie smiles as a waitress brings them their drinks. She's a woman with fox ears and numerous tails. Maddie
			recalls that she sparked many myths when she wasn't retired, and is the origin of the idea of a kitsune.
			She, much like Jeremy, loves working here, simply to see people every day. Standing up for long periods
			wasn't tiring for an angel.
		<p>
			"Thanks!" Maddie says to the woman, taking the drinks. She slides one to Mania.
		<p>
			"Have a great day, Maddie! And you too!" the angel says to the two of them.
		<p>
			Once the kitsune angel has moved on, Maddie turns to Mania again.
		<p>
			"Anyways, my manners are much better than my mom's, because you're the closest thing I have to a mom. Please
			please please just try the hot chocolate. It might surprise you. And we don't pay for things here. There's
			no currency of any kind; it's Heaven. You just get whatever you want."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“That can't be healthy. Eyeballs aren't cute. You should go get a therapist or something.”
		<p>
			She snatches the tempered glass mug of hot chocolate, bothered once more by this compulsion to actually eat
			and drink. Mania wonders if the kitsune waitress is aware that she symbolizes wealth and business to the
			culture of Japan. You know, the exact kind of principles that apparently were impossible here.
		<p>
			“Yeah, thank you,” She says too late to the waitress. It's definitely an interesting, informative day, at
			least. She didn't need a push of optimism for that.
		<p>
			She continues to Maddie, “Don't imply I'm your mom. I had kids and they're long dead now. You're not one of
			them. And, what, you just ask for things? What if you wanted a yacht? Thousands of acres of land? Is this
			communism? Pathetic political theory...”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie smiles, amused by Mania's comparison between the mortal world and Heaven.
		<p>
			"Yes, because the space in Heaven infinitely expands to make room for more people, you can have as much room
			as you want. I know a farmer who loved farming so much they got an area the size of Texas all to themself. I
			should check in on them sometime. And yes, anything. Someone has an entire battleship they converted into a
			home."
		<p>
			Maddie sips her hot chocolate, enjoying it greatly.
		<p>
			"I think your comparison to communism is funny. There's no politics here, we just kind of exist. Even
			communism implies some level of economics. Here, there's infinite of anything anyone could want. So no, it's
			not communism. In the literal sense. Also, yeah, in your current state, I'd be ashamed to have you as my
			mom. Someday, you'll be better. Maybe we'll even call each other friends. Drink your hot chocolate by the
			way."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"That's—well, that's completely ridiculous. There are much better ways of creating a paradise than
			leveraging everyone infinite resources. Not everyone deserves that, even in heaven. And what's the point of
			having truly infinite power just drop in your lap? It just feels pointless as a gift. It's just insane!”
		<p>
			She shakes her head, and she sips the hot chocolate that Maddie keeps nagging her about. Then, she
			immediately bursts into tears. She drinks the rest of her mug quickly, sobbing between long sips, and
			settles with her face in her arms on the table.
		<p>
			“It's so, so good. What even happened to me? I really haven't tasted a thing in centuries!?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie scoots up next to her, putting an arm over her shoulder.
		<p>
			"It's alright, I know this comes as a shock to finally realize just how much you've suffered. This is what I
			mean when I keep telling you that it's awful, and that it gets better."
		<p>
			Maddie slides Mania her own hot chocolate, offering it to her.
		<p>
			"Have mine. You seem like you need it more than I do."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania greedily accepts Maddie's mug, too, downing it twice as fast. She sniffles and she wipes her eyes with
			a napkin.
		<p>
			“Maddie, that's not really my point. I don't know what this is. I drank one too many hot pots of coffee or
			something down there—but why can I only taste things here? Can you order me something else? Those
			croissants?”
		<p>
			She's always had been under the impression she simply grew numb to the diverse flavor palette of human
			culture with all her amazing wealth and time for experiencing it. It would seem she has some catching up to
			do.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Of course! I'll go order some."
		<p>
			Maddie stands up and walks up to Jeremy again. She orders three croissants: one plain, one filled with
			custard, and one with chocolate filling. A few minutes later, she returns with the food, which she chose to
			wait for and carry to the table this time rather than waiting for the waitress.
		<p>
			"Here you go! This one's chocolate, this one's a normal one, and this one's got custard in it! Custard's my
			favorite."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			The demoness would embarrass herself with how much of these snacks and drinks she ends up stuffing into
			herself if, of course, she wasn't already so enthralled. To Hell with it if she gains weight. She could
			afford some gluttony.
		<p>
			Much later, she walks again on the civilian avenues with Maddie by her side. The weather is perfect. Of
			course it is. A large stretch of grass, trees, and rivers is right in the middle of this celestial city—or
			at least, what might be a middle of many middles in this vast dimension. They're approaching it, apparently.
			She hadn't even considered where they were going until now.
		<p>
			She asks, “How big is this city? Does it have a name or something?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"It's enormous. There's smaller cities farther out, but they can be travelled to very quickly. It's called
			the Gate, and it's where most Angels live and work. When they retire, they move to a house like a human
			soul."
		<p>
			Maddie leads Mania to a secluded bench in the park, surrounded by trees and a gurgling creek. Birdsong fills
			the air, as small woodland creatures are out and about.
		<p>
			"Isn't it nice here? Just the fresh air, perfect weather, and beautiful scenery. You should relax every once
			in a while!"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"And let's suppose that they don't want to retire. Can they live and work here forever?"
		<p>
			She sits on the bench, tapping her fingers against its metal rail to her right side. She sighs.
		<p>
			"I probably missed a couple appointments already. We should make this quick and then get me back to my
			office. But, yes, it is nice. I like the noise of the stream. It's different than watching TV. I hope this
			cream wears off when I go to below."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie looks at Mania and realizes that the cream probably will in fact be wearing off soon.
		<p>
			"Yeah, we have another hour at most before it wears off. And to answer your question, they can start and
			stop working whenever they want to. There are angels who have been working on and off since the Ice Age.
			I've only been around as long as you, of course."
		<p>
			Maddie stands up from the bench, the late afternoon light streaming from a sunless sky. She reaches out a
			hand to Mania, beckoning for her to take it.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"Well, they sure let you do a lot here. It's like a weird little retirement, even if you do work... Quick
			question, do you happen to know—God? Who runs this place? Who's pulling the strings?"
		<p>
			She frowns. Mania had once been a God-fearing woman of the late 1800s. Constant outspoken evangelists made
			religion a personal matter and, therefore, riddled everyone with guilt.
		<p>
			She ignores Maddie's hand, but she rubs her own forehead and says, "Thanks for giving me a tour."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie cocks her head.
		<p>
			"There's no 'God' and the closest thing to a ruling body is a council of Archangels. They work together to
			ensure everything works smoothly, although the input of every Angel is considered."
		<p>
			Maddie starts walking, leading Mania back to her apartment.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"It's frustrating how incorrect mortals are about the afterlife."
		<p>
			She walks with Maddie and kicks a pebble on the sidewalk. She rubs her arm sometimes, wondering if her cover
			will blow early. Of course they have a committee taking input. They think they're a damn paradise.
		<p>
			"They got one thing kind of right, though. We have a guy called Gideon where I'm from. I guess mortals would
			call him Satan. He gets the final say, votes be damned."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie notices her mild cursing, concerned.
		<p>
			"Oh wow, it really must be wearing off. We need to get to the elevator quickly."
		<p>
			They arrive at the apartment building, and Maddie opens the door, once again waving to Y'nara. They wave
			back to Maddie, before Maddie and Mania disappear into the elevator.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Just to be safe, Mania stays quiet until they're in the elevator. She presses the button, and they're
			plummeted to the underworld again. She sighs in relief, and she slouches against the wall and the ceiling.
		<p>
			"I'm so glad to be—damn fucking home again. Glad that's still working. Need to express myself somehow.
			Seriously, though, you're going to need to steal those recipes off of that eyeball's cafe. Or, I'll send you
			to screw right off and find the right chefs to work for me. You want to help me, after all, no?
		<p>
			It is her favorite excuse for asking Maddie for favors. She slips away to her personal bedroom.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie had already pieced together what happened to Mania, knowing that the only reason she could taste the
			food was the holy magic of the cream suppressing her hellish curses. Maddie follows her, walking into her
			bedroom.
		<p>
			"You know you're lying to yourself. Both of us know the only reason you could taste it was because we were
			in Heaven, and the cream was holding back your demonic curse. The food won't taste good, even if you baked
			it perfectly to be the same. Why won't you just accept that Hell sucks and you should pass on?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Her bedroom is the nicest room in the office building, which is to say it's a tiny, four-star suite. A
			mattress bolts to the ceiling above another in a metal bed frame with purple sheets. And purple linen hangs
			around the mattresses from the ceiling. Mania doesn't sleep, and so this room is mostly intended for her
			cursed sense of sexual desire.
		<p>
			She lies down on the ceiling mattress anyway, however. She laughs.
		<p>
			"Why don't you accept your heaven is dreadfully fucking boring and accept that you might be a little too
			used to the wholesome mundanity, hmm? Come on, it'll be fun. And bring me some of that holy cream if you're
			so sure."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Do you want a chocolate bar? I have one in my purse if you like. Maybe it'll calm you down."
		<p>
			Maddie produces a small chocolate bar from her purse, which she offers to the demon.
		<p>
			"Also, why do you have a bed? I didn't know demons sleep! Angels don't. Well, it's optional. I enjoy taking
			catnaps.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"I already had hot chocolate and a chocolate croissant, but what the Hell."
		<p>
			Fully aware that it is a mortal treat, she takes it from Maddie and bites into it. She then gags and drops
			it, and it careens off the bottom mattress.
		<p>
			"That shit tastes like vomit and not just because it's made in the USA, I think. Dammit. But that's fine, I
			guess. If we need that cream again like you're saying, then so be it. I'll eat later."
		<p>
			She folds her hands behind her white hair, and she continues, "I have a bed for when I join my clients. You
			should know by now a CEO like me never sleeps."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie blushes, now understanding what the bed is for.
		<p>
			"Alright then... was heaven really that bad? You seemed like you were enjoying it while we were there. I'm
			still going to take you again sometime, I really hope you warm up to it."
		<p>
			Maddie floats upside down and sits on the corner of the bed, much to the annoyance of Mania.
		<p>
			"I'll put some cream on you later so you can have something to eat. What are you going to do right now,
			anyways?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She smirks. The angel never approaches that one subject with any confidence at all.
		<p>
			"No, heaven was actually fine, if you want the truth. I'm just not interested in abandoning my prospects
			here—that wealth and power I so rightfully possess that I could never have over others in heaven. Fuck that.
			I earned this shit. Look around you. Everything else is capitalism. And I'm Miss Capitalism, baby!"
		<p>
			She pushes Maddie's back and rolls over.
		<p>
			"Why, I'll get back to work. But we'll go again sometime, sure... You know it's still awfully mischievous of
			you, right? I wonder what would happen if you got caught by your darling leaders and they saw how naughty
			you've been. Would they break your little halo and throw you down with me?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well, Angels are beings formed with only pure intentions. An Angel has never been punished simply because
			we aren't really able to do something truly wrong. My intentions are good; I simply am working to help you
			move on. I don't know if the higher ups of Hell would enjoy you going out to heaven, though. And what do you
			mean you earned this? You mean you're proud of how awful you were in life that you earned such a terrible
			punishment?"
		<p>
			Maddie lays back on the bed a bit, staring up at the floor.
		<p>
			"For someone so insufferable, I find it strangely enjoyable to hang out with you. I do hope we still see
			each other once in a while when you go to Heaven."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"But let's say that there's an angel who spends an unusually long time with her demon. And we can go further
			and say that this angel starts to like the demon, even wanting to 'hang out'. Then do you think there's a
			chance that the being of pure intentions can get a little corrupted? I do it all the time with mortals,
			after all. You wouldn't believe what corporate riches do to the nicest people you will ever meet."
		<p>
			She then feigns surprise, points at Maddie's head, and says, "Are those horns growing on your head!?" She
			laughs after a dreadful pause.
		<p>
			"Yeah, I'm proud. Few people would have had the courage, intensity, and work ethic that led me here."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie simply facepalms. "You've got a long way to go still, huh. Good thing I'm here forever."
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			About 20 years have passed since the first time Mania visited Heaven. Currently, Maddie is thanking her
			infinite patience as she stands near a group of demons who are chatting, drinking, and generally being
			demonic. In the room next to this one, several demons—some masculine, some feminine, and some
			androgynous—dance nude on a stage and poles. It's a massive party in Hell, one that Maddie attended just to
			supervise Mania. She's with the group that's chatting, back turned to Maddie. Maddie's wings and halo are
			out and shown, but she has been shown no respect because of them. Demons laugh at her and mock her, but
			they've shown no sign of trying to kick her out. Perhaps that was respect enough.
		<p>
			She taps Mania on the shoulder. "Why are you celebrating? What happened that all the demons would be
			partying like this? Surely you have more important things to do."
		<p>
			A demon walks by, giving her halo a whack, which causes it to swirl around Maddie's head like a gyroscope
			for a moment. Maddie turns to see who did it, but the demon has already blended into the crowd. It's the
			third time already that one has done this.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"What the fuck—Maddie? Where in the Hell have you been? Welcome!—Everyone, look, this is my angel. She
			claims I'm going to heaven. Can you believe that horseshit?"
		<p>
			One lankier demon with glasses and three short ones drinking wine back away from Maddie nervously, but the
			rest of them laugh and one even punches her shoulder. Mania, however, just smiles. Club music thumps from a
			subwoofer installed into one of the rock walls outside one of the broken windows. This particular district
			of ugly buildings has been ruined for as long as almost anyone could remember.
		<p>
			"You would be right, Maddie, but this is a very delightfully special occasion. The selfish and mutual
			nuclear destructions on New York City and Munic went through! Hardly anyone evacuated in time. Humans—those
			wretched bastards—I almost didn't think they had it in them. But their militant pride stops at nothing.
			Nothing! They've been selling and spending so, so much on weapons."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie rolls her eyes, clearly a bit annoyed.
		<p>
			"That's really why you're partying? Do you have any idea how much work cleaning up the mess this war has
			caused has been? I've taken like two thousand souls up in the last week! It's a disaster!"
		<p>
			Maddie gives Mania a mostly unwanted hug, her tail wagging back and forth.
		<p>
			"But I'm glad to see you're happy. How's it been? Sorry I haven't been around lately."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"Yep, that's why we're partying. I know you geriatrics in heaven like to party about things like when humans
			invented the self-cleaning catheter or whatever, but we like to keep it to the exciting drama, yeah? It's
			not my damn fault that your job is tedious. Just go fucking retire if you're so bored! Just don't forget to
			pay me visits, eh? I'd miss our dinner trips, miss your favors, and even miss your pathetic begging. Let the
			souls be someone else's problem."
		<p>
			Mania takes a cigarette from one of her peers, lighting it with the tip of her fingernail. She smokes
			despite the fact it does nothing for her jaded mind and body and despite the fact Maddie is trying to hug
			her. The demons stare expectantly at Maddie for some returning insult, one even covering her own mouth.
		<p>
			"It's been better than ever," She proposes.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie opens her mouth, but nothing comes out. Wordlessly, she closes her mouth and storms off away into the
			crowd, ears flat and tail down low.
		<p>
			"You're better than her, don't say anything back," she silently thinks to herself. Her patience was being
			tested after a long week of seeing charred corpses and ruined cities. She was on the brink of snapping at
			Mania but knows that it'll only make things worse. Lost in thought, she aimlessly wanders through the crowd
			of demons.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania scoffs, watches Maddie leave, and continues her banter with her wealth-obsessed peers.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Bonewagon_w">
		<p>
			The party rages on. The strangers who haven't been introduced to Maddie continue to treat her with
			remarkable ignorance. Purple, red, and blue disco lights buzz on and then flail around.
		<p>
			However, one unfamiliar demon, a mortal soul with two stubby horns and no tail at all, stares across the
			room at Maddie with piercing, hazel eyes. He pushes other demons out of the way and approaches straight for
			her. He waves when he's close enough to just say something to her instead, which he then does.
		<p>
			“Is that a costume?—I'd say that you must have fell right out of the sky, but I thought they put in that
			rocky ceiling here to prevent divine beauties like you from crashing by.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie blushes deeply, face turning a bright shade of red. Her tail waves shyly. She awkwardly waves at him.
		<p>
			"N-No, it's not a costume. I'm an angel, from heaven. I was just here to check on one of the demons..."
		<p>
			She trails off shyly, not sure what to say.
		<p>
			"But what do you need with me... d-demons don't usually like angels very much. They find us annoying..."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Bonewagon_w">
		<p>
			“A real-ass angel? You're really the real deal? That's nice of you to check in with one of us lousy chumps.
			Whoever they are, they must know they're really lucky to have someone as sexy and caring as you. What I
			need?”
		<p>
			He steps closer to the angel, and he touches her shoulder. His hand is cool.
		<p>
			“What I need, darling, is your name and number. I would never find you annoying. What awful demon is making
			you feel unwanted, huh? I could talk some sense into them.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie gives the demon something of a quizzical look, although she is still blushing.
		<p>
			"I'm Maddie, h-hello. M-my number? I don't think calling a Heaven number from hell would work..." she trails
			off once more, realizing that he probably doesn't literally want her number.
		<p>
			"Don't worry about the other demons, they probably just don't know what to do with an angel around... it's
			really fine, I promise."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Bonewagon_w">
		<p>
			“I'm Mr. Rowan Chavez. You ought to just call me Bonewagon. And that's totally fine, who needs numbers
			really. Let's just make the best of right now. How's that sound, babe?”
		<p>
			He smiles, putting his other hand on her other exposed shoulder now. He rubs them, studying her soft and
			pleased expression. Much more attentive than Mania, anyway.
		<p>
			“I'm only going to worry myself with you, then. What do you want, Maddie? Why are you really here, if you're
			wandering off from the demon you checked on, hmm?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, I got a bit mad at her. It's really nothing, demons are just like that sometimes. S-so what exactly do
			you want with me? If you aren't after my number what do you want? Are you trying to get to heaven? I can
			help you out with that."
		<p>
			Maddie nervously fidgets with her purse, not used to someone being so forward with her. Her normally calm
			demeanor is utterly gone, at this point in time.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Bonewagon_w">
		<p>
			“Wait is that an option? You can get me into heaven, just like that?”
		<p>
			He waves his hand in the arc of a rainbow in front of Maddie and him, and then he bursts into laughter.
		<p>
			“Alright, alright, I'd be very grateful if you could do that for me obviously. But first, I want to have a
			little bit of fun with you. That'll cure you of your anger, you know. So what do you say, doll? Are you
			ready for me?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			With the question of heaven brought up, Maddie goes on a tangent.
		<p>
			"Well, it'll take you a while. Depends on what you did in life, and how willing to let go of your sins. Some
			devils, like Mania, will take hundreds of years. You look pretty new here, so it'll take a while... oh. What
			do you mean, have a little fun? Are you going to show me something? Sure, I'll go with you. I like having
			fun from time to time."
		<p>
			Maddie looks at him expectantly, waiting for him to lead her to wherever they were going.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Bonewagon_w">
		<p>
			“Oh, I tortured a few prisoners of war. But I'm better now, really. I'm serving my time, showing you some
			fun, and then you'll just snatch me out of here. Deal? So let's get started, Maddie.”
		<p>
			He winks at two fellow demon men, who holler at the angel and him. He leads her away from the densest part
			of this building, away from Mania and the mob.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania's eyes contact Maddie's, however, as Mania slides away to a quiet room with a succubus as well-endowed
			as she is glamorous.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			...
		<p>
			Maddie steps out of the room, significantly more aware of what humans and demons find to be enjoyable. It
			wasn't unpleasant by any means, but her mind wanders. It definitely could've been better, but she can't put
			her finger on why. Then, looking around, she sees Mania coming out of a similar room and makes eye contact
			with her. Maddie blushes fiercely and then realizes why it could've been better. While she was in that room,
			she couldn't stop thinking about Mania. She nervously walks up to Mania, taking her hand.
		<p>
			"H-hi Mania. Is the party almost over? I should get back to work... Don't you have work to do too? Shouldn't
			we go home now?"
		<p>
			Maddie clearly wants to leave the party. She's a bit uncomfortable but wants Mania to come with her. She
			wants a familiar face to chat with, even if the face in question will ridicule her.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania accepts Maddie's hand. She's panting.
		<p>
			“Yeah, Maddie. Teleport me home, please. It'd take forever to walk. I'm bored for now. I'll try again
			tomorrow, and I'll bring some damn alcohol that time or something.”
		<p>
			She fakes a gesture of slitting her own throat at the succubus leaving the same room Mania came from, the
			same nymphomaniac Mania spent the hour with.
		<p>
			“Look, I'm done—I'm not going to cum. It won't happen. Get lost.”
		<p>
			The succubus sighs coyly and spreads herself on the carpet for anyone else to see. Mania faces Maddie again.
			The catgirl's hair is unkempt.
		<p>
			“What the Hell happened to you? You definitely fucked that guy. Aren't your kind supposed to keep their
			shiny pants on?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie fidgets, clearly nervous about answering the question.
		<p>
			"I uh, got curious. You look like you did something similar, though. Y-yeah, let's go back home.
		<p>
			Maddie's halo flashes, and they are transported back to Mania's tower. Walking on shaky legs, Maddie
			stumbles onto the couch. Unbeknownst to her, it's extremely easy to see up her skirt. She's not wearing
			anything underneath it, apart from some white stains.
		<p>
			"Angels can pretty much do as they please. I'm sure plenty of angels do this kinda stuff."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Well, no shit, I'm a demon afflicted with sexual desires I didn't ask for. You're just someone convinced
			that she should help people.”
		<p>
			Mania lays down on the other end of the couch, and she stares at Maddie's exposed body from this angle. She
			smirks, and she removes her binder with her schedule from her purse.
		<p>
			“What a nice pussy you are... Giving yourself up to just anyone like you're worthless.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie blushes as she realizes that she forgot her underwear. The blush grows deeper as she realizes that
			Mania can see up her skirt and the cumstains around her pussy. Maddie hurriedly pushes down her skirt,
			trying to preserve some semblance of modesty.
		<p>
			"H-hey, stop that! You do it all the time, don't call me worthless... I was just curious."
		<p>
			Maddie looks disheveled and exhausted as she lies on the couch, clearly not used to having sex.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I didn't say you're worthless. I said that you did that 'like' you're worthless. Be as curious as you want,
			you weirdo. Just get some damn standards.”
		<p>
			She shrugs and updates something into her schedule, dismissing Maddie. She'll have a stab at an elite liquor
			store after some sensitive meetings in East Europe and East Asia. It's a great time to be a capitalist and a
			consumer.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			Twenty years have passed since the war ended. Fortunately, only two nukes were launched, and the world was
			spared from a bright and violent end.
		<p>
			A man in a suit walks down a quiet street in a rundown neighborhood at the outskirts of a city. Walking, he
			fishes for a key in his pocket. He unlocks the door to a narrow three-story building and then goes up to the
			second floor. Walking through the apartment, he enters a child's bedroom, where a young girl is lying in
			bed. She hasn't left the bed in weeks.
		<p>
			A woman with cat ears and a halo stands in the corner, unseen by both the man and his daughter.
		<p>
			Maddie senses that the child's life is burning out, like a candle in the breeze. With this moment at hand,
			she disappears from the room, reappearing next to Mania. She gently takes her hand.
		<p>
			"Hey, I think we should check on Aaron. Come with me."
		<p>
			She teleports them both back into the apartment, concealing the two of them from the mortals' vision.
		<p>
			"She's about to die. All that work, for nothing. Every day, six days a week, he's been working ten hours.
			And it's barely been enough to cover the medical expenses."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania leans against the wall, and she crosses her arms. It's just been back to normal afterlife with her CEO
			work and Maddie these years. It's too early to even stir some more shit up in world politics.
		<p>
			“Hello again, Aaron,” She says tiredly. “I'm not sure why Maddie insists you're worth my time. You're
			obviously just some guy who couldn't handle some pressure.”
		<p>
			The man buckles his knees against the bed frame and leans forward. He runs his hands through his daughter's
			light hair. He's tearing up and saying nothing, drawn by remorse.
		<p>
			Mania looks away. “What do you want, Maddie?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"You know he can't hear you. As I was going to say, you value hard work as the route to success. Which for
			some, is true. But this man has been working long hours, as hard as he can, to keep his daughter alive. And
			it's all going to be pointless. Is that really a good system? Where you can work so hard you nearly collapse
			each day, but fail anyways? Doesn't something seem wrong with that?"
		<p>
			Maddie stares into Mania's eyes, looking more serious than she ever has in the time they've been together.
		<p>
			"Won't you let go of this fantasy you live in, where you think that money and success truly goes to those
			who deserve it?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Don't tell me what I fucking value.”
		<p>
			Mania avoids Maddie's gaze, irritated in some remarkably shy way. She taps her fingernails together slowly.
			Aaron's daughter has only tilted her head and moved three fingers.
		<p>
			“You don't live in my fucking head. He applied for dozens of better-paying positions and none of them hired
			him. He worked hard in the meantime but his work wasn't good enough. He must suck at his job, to be frank,
			so he's not worth much. That's the way it is. If you do bad jobs, it doesn't matter if you try. I'm great at
			what I do, and that's why I'm the richest on the damn planet. So give it up.”
		<p>
			She frowns. “So, yes, if he works this hard and fails, he never deserved success. It's that simple. I bet if
			we did a background check we'd find this guy is an asshole.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"So you think that some people can work hard and still fail? You blame it on luck. And that same luck is
			where you got to where you are. You didn't simply work hard and magically get rich. You got lucky. I had an
			archangel in heaven perform a calculation of the chances that someone would get even a single percent of
			your wealth, and it was close to one in one hundred million. People don't just 'work hard' and succeed.
			They. Get. Lucky. Like how this man got extraordinarily unlucky, and his daughter caught a fatal disease."
		<p>
			Maddie speaks the words like knives cutting into Mania, some semblance of anger and frustration starting to
			show.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I don't blame it on luck. Are you even listening to me? Isn't that your whole damn job?”
		<p>
			But she stops retorting. The space between Maddie and her becomes something foggy and distant, and Mania's
			innate demonic aura slightly ripples. Their frequent escapades in Heaven would disrupt it all the time, but
			it's never been disrupted before without the angelic cream. But Mania shivers all the same.
		<p>
			“How dare you insinuate that I'm only here because of some dumb fucking luck. I deserve every fucking penny.
			I earned every penny. Keep me out of your fucking argument. I'd like to talk to this fucking archangel and
			clarify I mean people who actually work their ass off, okay? Don't bullshit statistics on me. It's not
			luck...”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Seeing this moment of vulnerability, Maddie presses the attack.
		<p>
			"This is why you can't let go. You're a spoiled brat. Just because you got lucky and got filthy rich, you
			blame the hard work you put in for getting you there. Sure, you worked hard. And I commend you for that. But
			not everyone who works hard reaps the rewards. And you can't seem to get it through your horned skull that
			that's the case. You think you're so much better than everyone else because you lucked out and succeeded and
			they didn't."
		<p>
			Maddie glances over towards the sick child and then grits her teeth. Tears well in her eyes.
		<p>
			"She's dead."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			The demon's eyes glow brighter. She trades glances with the corpse of Aaron's daughter. She sees the failure
			of a man who worked as hard as he physically could without dying of exhaustion himself. A failure that
			Maddie is pinning to the worst concept Mania can ever think to attribute to anything earnest—unaccountable
			whim and chance. It's evil beyond anything she would ever stand for as well as a direct threat to her. She
			shivers a lot more. She punches Maddie's jaw.
		<p>
			Maddie challenged her.
		<p>
			“I fucking hate you! I'm never letting you fucking relax again, you piece of garbage. Leave me alone, I
			really mean it. I'm going to figure out a way to make you feel pain otherwise. Nobody tells me I'm a brat
			and a fraud.”
		<p>
			She darts out of the room so energized that three of the lights on the way out of the building flicker from
			her mere presence. She also topples a trashcan outside.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie stands there for a moment, speechless. Then she sees the soul of the girl, staring at her. She steps
			up and hugs the poor child, crying. Still crying, she lifts her up, and brings her up to heaven.
		<p>
			Aaron died the next morning, struck fatally by a car. At least he got reunited with his daughter.
		<p>
			Maddie teleports back to her apartment, crying for a full hour. She's scared, scared that Mania truly cannot
			be saved. But eventually, she wipes her eyes, and strengthens her resolve. She saw the flicker in Mania's
			form. She was getting to her. All she had to do was keep trying. She warps back to Mania's home.
		<p>
			"You know I won't give up, right? I'm not letting you continue to suffer."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			The demoness turns the computer monitor off at the cubicle she's squatting inside, and she rubs both of her
			eyes as if she lodged something inside both.
		<p>
			“Look who decided to show up. Can we have a round of applause, imps?”
		<p>
			None of the imps do that, though. Some of them are playing with a basketball by the empty water cooler, and
			three are gossiping in a cubicle in the corner. Mania plants her chin on the desk.
		<p>
			“I've been doing some... Independent research. So you're right: luck probably is a factor after all. That
			just means I've been blessed by something to be more lucky because I deserve it more for all my hard work.
			The world is very mysterious like that.”
		<p>
			She balls her hands into fists under the desk, squeezing her fingers hard.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie closes her eyes and puts a hand on her forehead, clearly somewhat annoyed at the demon.
		<p>
			"Really? All that, and you conclude that you're 'magically blessed'? Do you even realize just how absurd it
			is to say that you're 'blessed'? You're literally in hell! The opposite of being blessed! You're just coping
			with the fact that you aren't simply successful because you worked hard, but because you lucked out. You
			were so close to figuring it out. So close... please, just let go already."
		<p>
			Maddie walks up, and awkwardly hugs the demon due to the fact that Mania is squatting down.
		<p>
			"Come on. You're so close to realizing."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania closes her eyes and sighs deeply.
		<p>
			“I'm not usually wrong. I don't want to really believe you. Could we just move on—let me have this
			one—please?”
		<p>
			She pats Maddie's shoulder and then pushes her away from the cubicle. And she follows this with leaving the
			cubicle herself and rag dolling onto the nearest couch on the ceiling.
		<p>
			“Nevermind. I know what you're going to tell me next. How about you win? Are you happy? You've ruined my
			fucking month. You're an angel and you've managed to make me feel worse. I'm giving you a bad review on the
			customer support page. Zero stars. So go on then, gloat as much as your little ego can.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie walks over to the couch without a word. She bends down and, without warning, gives Mania a kiss on
			the cheek.
		<p>
			"I don't want you to feel bad. This is just a step in getting over your pain. To get out of here. I promise
			that once I get you out of hell I'll stop bothering you if you want me to. Maybe you'll never have to see me
			again! Wouldn't that be great? But for now, I have a job to do. My job is to get you out of hell, purified
			and free of sin. And I'm working very hard to do that. I really do hope my hard work pays off."
		<p>
			Maddie looks down at the demon, smiling faintly at her own mention of 'hard work.'

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Sorry, if nobody else gets to be rewarded off of their pure hard work, then neither do you. You'll need a
			miracle to get me to actually agree with you about leaving my awesome role here. Even if I got a little
			lucky to begin with.”
		<p>
			She drags a blanket over her head. She groans. She's a touch weaker. Her aura is thinner—almost as thin as
			the blanket.
		<p>
			“Couple of questions, Maddie. Humor me. What the Hell do you mean you'll purify me of sin, again? I'm pretty
			sure there'd be nothing left. Pretty sure I've got all seven of them.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, stop it. Every time you falter, every time you question your current situation—that's the human soul
			that's been trapped as a demon. The real person. You're like a husk of your former, too drowned in your own
			misery to see it. My job is to dive down there and bring you to the surface. To pull you from your sin. And
			once you're free, you'll realize how ridiculous you're being. And you'll have no trouble moving on."
		<p>
			Without skipping a beat, Maddie catches the basketball, which an imp failed to catch and bounced across the
			room. It collapses and fizzles away into yellow light. It was a distraction.
		<p>
			"Your demonic aura is so, so weak. You're as weak as a demon fresh from the grave."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			The imp who missed the catch curses Maddie out and jogs out of the room with his little lumpy friend. It's
			second nature to receive such insults. Mania turns the television on for a listless news broadcast, and she
			pinches the bridge of her nose.
		<p>
			“I don't see how being an angel is so damn different. If my reasoning is so clouded, so is yours! How are
			you so sure you're not completely washed sterile of any fucking personality, huh? Ever heard of the seven
			virtues? You're not sure—we should just both live our great afterlives, alright?”
		<p>
			She mutes the television and coughs.
		<p>
			“Question two. Why are you so fucking confident they'd let a lowly lady like you steal me out of here? Don't
			you realize how important I am to Hell, lucky or not? You see any other 'weak' demons with big-ass towers,
			warping human fate?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie sits down next to Mania. She leans against her, looking at the muted television.
		<p>
			"I... really don't know if I experience emotions the way a human does. I'll never know and never will know.
			But I exist to have sympathy for humans and help them."
		<p>
			She leans closer in, a soft cat ear brushing against Mania's cheek.
		<p>
			"You really seem to value your importance in Hell. Why are you so attached to your prison? You're just
			another cog in their machine. There's so so many souls that pass on each day. They'll have you replaced
			within minutes, I'm certain of it. And besides..."
		<p>
			Maddie looks like she was about to say something, but she then stops herself and blushes slightly.
		<p>
			"I... uh... just really think you'll like not being in hell."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“At least you're honest with your bad opinions,” Mania sighs. She watches the newsreader's pupils flicker in
			the glow of the teleprompter. She pushes Maddie further from her on the couch.
		<p>
			“Like, you definitely don't act like a damn human being. Nobody acts like you. People lie and hurt each
			other and try to get on top of things and assert their power. That's what it's like, you know. I have more
			experience in that little department, alright? Anyway, no, they wouldn't ever want to replace me at all.
			Nobody running this show actually wants fuck all to change. That's Hell, and I'm the CEO of Hell... I'm
			giving you no more than a minute and then I'm going straight back to work. I'm behind.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie pushes up to Mania, gently shoving her onto her side. She scoots up to her and then flops over her,
			purring softly. Wordlessly, she stays on top of Mania, snuggling her and for all the world as heavy as a
			sack of hammers.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Even reversing her gravity fails to make Maddie pry.
		<p>
			“You know that's not what I fucking meant!”
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			The demon lies on her face on the cold, pearly floor. Classical music plays from the gramophone on the
			shelf.
		<p>
			“Oh, Offenbach, you died too young. Think he's around here somewhere?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, Offenbach? He loves music so much he sometimes performs up here in Heaven. I've gone once, about 50
			years ago. Wonderful stuff. I admire his dedication to the craft, even in retirement."
		<p>
			Maddie sits on the floor next to Mania, watching her plant her face on the ground.
		<p>
			"You really seem to like this gramophone I got you. Wouldn't a radio or a computer have done a better job?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I'd say you could have invited me, but that's a crock of shit—ah, good, the holy cream is finally giving up
			again. I've already overstayed my welcome. But it's been interesting as always.”
		<p>
			She smirks with the slow return of the healthy red aura. She rubs her forehead and sits up.
		<p>
			“Yes, of course those would have been more convenient. But I felt kind of nostalgic. You can hear the
			scratches on the vinyl. I'm telling you that not even an AI can do that. And they damn well do everything.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie tilts her head quizzically, one ear down flat and the other pointing up.
		<p>
			"Huh? What's an... 'Ayy Eye'? Is this something like Jeremy? He's an eye."
		<p>
			Maddie notices the aura return and gives Mania a concerned look.
		<p>
			"Oh dear. Is it really already time to go? Do you want to stay a little longer? I can reapply the cream if
			you like."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Nope. AI is artificial intelligence... Speaking of which, are you familiar with the concept of the
			technological singularity? Humanity may be finally getting close to being responsible for sin greater than
			any of us could ever imagine. I think—”
		<p>
			Mania clutches her forehead tightly, and she gawks at Maddie like she's devil's food cake. She slides her
			ass over to her. And her tone is terribly wispy, shaky, and warm. She grabs Maddie's shoulders.
		<p>
			“Fuck. I don't need this shit to happen. I knew I should have fucked someone yesterday!”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie gazes into Mania's eyes, seeing the lust in them.
		<p>
			"Oh... uhh... you could do it with me? I'm pretty sure demons can safely have sex with angels. I-I wouldn't
			mind it, you know."
		<p>
			Maddie breaks free from Mania's grasp and sinks onto the couch, giving her a pleading look. The desire is
			visible in her eyes and expression.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“You're such a horny loser—just once. You're getting this once. Pervert.”
		<p>
			Mania kicks off the stylus from the record player and then jumps the cat girl. She kisses her with a fiery
			dispassion. Maddie's casual top and leggings fall to the floor. And her arms are pressed flat and firm to
			the cushion. Mania hasn't even changed into her red lace.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie returns the kiss and then makes an indecipherable noise as she seemingly melts into the couch. She
			hugs Mania tight, kissing her once again.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania enters into a cycle of this sloppy, hard kissing and deep breathing. Their white hairs blur together,
			and Mania's long fingers reach under Maddie's panties. Bonewagon knew nothing of pleasuring a woman, after
			all...

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			...
		<p>
			Maddie lies on the couch next to Mania, exhausted and stained with her and Mania's fluids. She purrs softly,
			her naked body pressed up against Mania's. She wishes the moment could last forever.
		<p>
			"T-thanks for that. That was really wonderful."
		<p>
			She gently strokes the demon's hair, giving her a soft kiss on the cheek.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“It wasn't for you, Maddie.”
		<p>
			The demon dabs her horns with a damp paper towel. She's already cleaned her face, nipples, and crotch. She's
			as drowsy as possible.
		<p>
			“I don't understand Heaven, honestly. If you were pretty much created to care about me, your Assumer
			apparently, I don't see why you're also a whore. I'm just saying.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Well, maybe there's a bit of you in me, you know. Some flickers of actual passion and love from when you
			were a human."
		<p>
			With that profound and insightful comment, Maddie begins to lick herself clean like a cat. She even licks
			Mania a couple of times in an affectionate gesture.
		<p>
			"Would you like to nap on the couch before you go back home? I'd say you have another hour before someone
			notices your presence."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She steps away from Maddie, and she collects her purse from the coffee table. She saunters to the front
			door, and she leans on it. She pushes her chin up.
		<p>
			“I don't fucking nap. And I would rather not delay anything else any further. I'm sure you understand at
			least that by now... By the way, can you stop acting like I was better off a damn human? I didn't make an
			empire while I was alive even worth purchasing stocks in. Hell, I wasn't even really called Mania.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Why did you change your name to Mania? It’s a bit... on the nose, don't you think?"
		<p>
			Maddie turns away from Mania and scoops something off the couch, stuffing it in her pocket.
		<p>
			"Oh well. I'll see you later. Have a safe trip back home!"
		<p>
			Maddie gives her a quick smooch on the cheek and then goes back to her room.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"I didn't choose it. I was gifted it by Kuma."
		<p>
			Her voice lowers as if this ancient Demon of Fate could hear them otherwise.
		<p>
			"It suits me much better. And I enjoy how direct it is. Thank you. But stop kissing me: you're really
			getting on my nerves."
		<p>
			She slips away into the hallway. She hopes Maddie gets over her annoying infatuation...

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			Mania walks down a metal staircase from a metropolitan apartment complex. She takes a gold-color electronic
			cigarette from her purse and inhales deeply, and she reexamines the contract for her latest client. It
			doesn't taste like any fucking fruit to her, but this kind of product of nicotine hasn't completely worn off
			effectiveness on her yet. It would soon.
		<p>
			She tears through the contract with her fingernails. Four robot vacuum cleaners the size and shape of hockey
			pucks swarm in to suck in the pieces on the sidewalk. All but one then immediately disperse: Mania put her
			heel on it.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie fades into existence in a soft glow of light a few feet away from Mania, standing in the street on
			her left.
		<p>
			"Seems a bit rude to take out your anger on a cleaner. What's got you so worked up? Did you mess up a
			contract?"
		<p>
			The angel walks up to her, watching the robots flee with the collected scraps of paper.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I don't mess up,” She says. She wiggles the vape, offering it for the angel. She's frowning. “No, it's
			nothing. This lady got her just desserts. Let's go to my office.”
		<p>
			She steps away, and the vacuum she trapped leaves too. A fine mist leads into a pelting rain in a matter of
			seconds, and Mania in her drenched suit looks at Maddie expectantly.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie follows, taking a hit of the vape. She barely feels any effects of it due to her angelic nature, but
			she entertains Mania and does it out of politeness rather than desire.
		<p>
			"Who are you screwing over this time? This isn't going to end like that poor man who fell into a sawmill,
			right? That was a bit grisly. I had to reach in and pull out his soul."
		<p>
			Maddie manifests an umbrella, the top looking like Jeremy's crystalline eye. She holds it over herself and
			the demon, keeping them dry.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She stashes the device away. She stays in arm's length from Maddie under the umbrella.
		<p>
			“Ms. Edith. She was unusually hopeless. I didn't bother to give her wealth directly. I knew she'd squander
			it before she even felt the consequences. I didn't feel like changing her pathetic little attitude either.
			So, when I showed up to her call, I altered things so that she married one of my already wealthy, bastard
			clients. That would have been enough misery for her greed.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"That's unusually cruel for you, isn't it. Forced marriages were globally outlawed almost 50 years ago by
			this point!"
		<p>
			Despite this, Maddie gives Mania a peck on the cheek, a habit she had started recently.
		<p>
			"Sorry it's not going well. Actually I'm... not sorry? I'm supposed to be stopping you from doing well in
			that regard. But it's nice to see you! What exactly is so bad about this though. Seems fairly average for
			you."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“She agreed to the marriage in the contract's fine print. Anyway, though, I underestimated Paulo. Asshole
			doesn't keep his damn hands off of her. He's threatened her with more than just his finances.”
		<p>
			She closes her eyes.
		<p>
			“It's pretty much average, yes... I just didn't expect it. You don't have to be sorry—I don't really care,
			Maddie. You've barely ever stopped me, either.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh come on. We both know the fine print is unknowable bullshit. And I know you know I'm not allowed to just
			go and vaporize the man. You're just... oddly worked up about this. It's not like you. You never feel bad
			for your victims."
		<p>
			She wraps an arm around Mania's shoulder, trying to calm her down.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			She politely slips away from her arm.
		<p>
			“I don't feel fucking bad for her. She was worthless, and now she's—well, punished for her wants without any
			real work ethic. I just was surprised. Can't I be surprised?”
		<p>
			She furrows her eyebrows and avoids looking at Maddie's divine gaze. Mania's aura flickers as it did a long
			time ago.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie gives her a quizzical stare.
		<p>
			"What were you possibly surprised by? You wrote the contract to ruin her life, and it did. It went exactly
			as expected. I think you feel bad about this, don't you..."
		<p>
			Maddie notices the aura flicker and, for a moment, sees Mania for who she really was—in her divine sight,
			for a fleeting moment. Or possibly who she still is. A scared human woman, terrified at losing the things
			she had worked so hard to gain, gone mad with fear and her own success. Then the demon is back, with only
			traces of humanity. Perhaps Maddie simply was seeing what she had wanted to see.
		<p>
	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania stops walking, and she grabs the umbrella handle. They're sort of holding hands.
		<p>
			“Just teleport me to my office. I'm in a bad mood, twat. Everyone has those days.”
		<p>
			Mania has been enjoying Maddie's little blue officewear even if little else between them is in common. She's
			been toying with granting Maddie some kind of position in her company's hierarchy—one impossible to fuck up.
			The demon huffs her vape again.
		<p>
			“There's been rumors in Hell that human suffering reached a new low. I'd be willing to wager your working
			hours are fucking measly lately.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Isn't it wonderful! Humans are going so far, I'm extremely proud of them. World hunger looks like it'll be
			solved in the next fifty years! It's been great to not have to bring hundreds of dead children per day.
			World peace has been great."
		<p>
			Maddie shifts her hand on the umbrella handle to put it over Mania's, enjoying the feeling of her warm skin.
		<p>
			"My hours have been lower, I suppose from a human standpoint. Not really an issue because there aren't wages
			or anything. You just get whatever you need and want, after all. It gives me more time to spend with you!"
		<p>
			With that, Maddie gives Mania a quick peck on the cheek.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			It'll be too easy to usher the strange angel into answering phone calls as a secretary, Mania decides. And a
			simple gesture would always guide her to Mania's bedroom for the duty not written in ink. So, Mania digs
			into her purse for her usual enchanted materials. And she shows her a new contract. The text is stable,
			legible, and boring.
		<p>
			“All this human progress is really hurting our big industries, to spoil you on the fucking truth, but I
			digress. Allow me to offer you something charitable for a change—an opportunity for further work. I'll be
			your boss. Do you have any questions for me?”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie glances over it, noting the honesty and lack of tricks. She chuckles, then takes it from her.
		<p>
			"Sure, why not. It's a nice excuse to spend more time with you. You don't need to pay me or anything, by the
			way. Well, maybe pay me with a kiss every now and then."
		<p>
			She signs the contract, putting a little smiley face cat next to her signature, and passes it back to Mania.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"That's great. I was already planning to rely on your fine interest in me instead of financial compensation.
			I'm not paying those damn imps either, as you're aware."
		<p>
			She laughs in her obnoxious, endearing way. The contract slides into her black binder, and they continue
			after all into the nearest elevator. The digital prompts on the control screen are overridden by Mania's
			touch, instead replaced by a red error message and their familiar plummet into Hell. She smiles oddly. She's
			pleased like someone would be after meditation, not in the way a vigilante is from successfully robbing a
			bank.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie steps out of the elevator and then takes a seat on the couch. She gives one of the imps a smile and a
			small wave, and in return they scowl and scurry away.
		<p>
			"So, what are you even going to work on now? You seem to still be getting quite a few clients nowadays. I
			can help you say hi to one if you like!"
		<p>
			Maddie smiles at her cheerfully, knowing that the last thing the demon wants is for Maddie to ruin her
			chances at tricking someone into taking a bad deal.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania grabs the end of Maddie's tail and plucks it from the cushions. She points at her desk on the ceiling,
			stuffed in its square of a cubicle.

			“Quite funny to envision in our imaginations, but no. You'll just answer office phone calls, the email, and
			the fax machine while I'm away from Ulterior Inc. for my business appointments. Sort the important requests
			for me. Do you think you can handle that, or is the virtuous little voice in your head going to disrupt
			things?”
		<p>
			Mania presses two fingernails into Maddie's forehead.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie lets out a surprised meow when her tail is yanked, jumping up a little.
		<p>
			"But it's on the ceiling! How am I supposed to help you up there? All of the blood will rush to my head!
		<p>
			Maddie feigns panic and then gives a playful smile as she flips herself upside down and attaches to the
			ceiling.
		<p>
			"I'm sure it'll be fine. After all, helping you out is bringing you closer to salvation! Where do you want
			me to sit? Should I just use yours?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“Yeah, whatever. Maybe someday I'll retire at this desk and let polite and pretty grunts like you do all the
			dirty work for me. That's salvation right there.”
		<p>
			Mania puts her middle finger between her own lips, and then she sits on her office chair beside Maddie. She
			pats on the top of the catgirl's head. She then pushes it lower, forcing Maddie to bend over and sit on her
			knees.
		<p>
			“It's that time again. I want you under the damn desk. Prove you're good at taking some orders from me.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			In a needlessly overkill display of her power, Maddie appears next to Mania in a flash of golden light. She
			gives Mania a quick smooch on the cheek and then teleports back under the desk, wearing a significantly more
			revealing outfit now.
		<p>
			"Oh, I was waiting for you to get desperate again. I looked at some human outfits and thought this one was
			cute. Do you like the cat shaped window in the bra?"
		<p>
			Maddie smiles at her, her double-ended tail wagging in anticipation as she looks up at the demon.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			Mania lies beside Maddie on the mattress on her private bedroom floor. She sips from an expensive,
			artificially barrel-aged whiskey in a slim glass. And the television is showing something they have seen
			nine times already from the primitive age of subscription streaming services.
		<p>
			"Have you been keeping track of what time it is again, or is it time you order yourself a stupid paper
			planner?"
		<p>
			She pats Maddie's head.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie lays her head into Mania's lap, eyes half closed. She purrs softly at the pats, enjoying the
			cuddling.
		<p>
			"I'm sure I have some time right now. I think you're worrying too much. I have it all planned out, anyways.
			I haven't missed a day of work since two weeks after I manifested."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"What the Hell happened two weeks after that? There's no chance you felt like fucking slacking off that
			day."
		<p>
			Her eyes pierce through the back of Maddie's head. She reaches for her phone and closes the message from a
			prospective client. Then, she digs her nails into Maddie's neck.
		<p>
			"I got you something, secretary. What I was trying to tell you is that it's been almost two hundred years
			since you unkindly forced yourself into my afterlife. That's this year. I checked."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, did you bake me a cake? I like cake."
		<p>
			Maddie's tail wags, thumping against the mattress as she stares at Mania expectantly.
		<p>
			"It's like our anniversary! Do you want a kiss?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"No. The abandoned break room does not count as a kitchen just because it has a microwave, idiot."
		<p>
			Mania slips from the bed and opens a seldom-used closet. She takes from it a six-pack of silver cans, and
			she returns to Maddie.
		<p>
			"Just bought these cheap-ass hard seltzers for you while shopping for my own liquor. Against my better
			judgment. They were on a sale, and I—thought I should?"
		<p>
			She shrugs. "You kiss me an awful lot, Maddie. I get it, I'm sexy."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie looks at the cans with slight concern.
		<p>
			"Well, alcohol doesn't usually work for me. Come to think of it, I've never had any outside of Heaven. I
			don't know if it's suppressed by heaven or by the fact that I'm an angel. Guess now is the time to find
			out!"
		<p>
			Before Mania can hand her a can, Maddie gives her a deep kiss and then pulls away smiling.
		<p>
			"Happy anniversary! I'll get you out of here soon enough."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			"I sincerely doubt you'd be allowed to have any fun with mortal drugs. Although sex, on the other hand, has
			been considered a kind of drug by some great thinkers, some real philosophers. What do I know?"
		<p>
			She returns the smile and snaps the can off from the biodegradable, sea-life friendly, membrane rings.
		<p>
			"Drink and shut up, little angel. We're so privileged here. Don't you like working with the wealthiest
			person of all history? I'm nothing without my company, I already told you. Just a poor little woman from
			1813."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie takes a can and pops it open. She takes a couple sips.
		<p>
			"Why do you even run the company still? It's not like you're actually making money or anything. You're
			actually accomplishing nothing by working! You're pretty much failing at running a business while
			benefitting the higher-ups of Hell by causing more suffering."
		<p>
			She takes another sip, although it looks like she's only drinking out of politeness.
		<p>
			"Without the company, you aren't nothing! For starters, you're my friend! That means something, right?"
		<p>
			Maddie smiles at her from over the can, tail waving gently.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			Mania swigs from her slim glass of whiskey. She wants it to do anything for her, but it doesn't.
		<p>
			"This business is the business of mortal suffering. That's what makes the damn money. I'm rewarded for my
			commitment with riches apparently beyond your comprehension—and I'm my own boss. Fuck these other higher
			ups. I do my job, and it's like they don't even exist! Imagine that, a woman with a big man's company and a
			big man's salary and a big man's fucking respect."
		<p>
			She tosses her empty glass aside and does jazz hands. She soon sits her chin on her palm and watches the
			television flicker. The fiber optics couldn't prevent new problems from emerging.
		<p>
			"Maddie. What I'm getting at is that I have a lot to lose and that I've been working hard to prevent that.
			Let's just be friends without tacking on a bankruptcy, yeah?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Who are you even getting the respect of? No one in the mortal world knows about you. To them you're just
			some lady who died in the 1800s. The demons clearly don't respect you much or you'd have a higher position
			in the operations of hell."
		<p>
			Maddie finishes her glass and fidgets with the television a bit, and the flickering stops.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“It's the worst mistake the Demons of Fate make, not appointing me to their status.”
		<p>
			She places an arm across Maddie's lower back.
		<p>
			“I know my clients and the other demons hate me. I don't fucking care. I love me. That's an image I enjoy
			and respect—mine! Isn't self-love one of the virtues?”
		<p>
			She grabs the angel's thigh.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie blushes a bit when Mania starts touching her.
		<p>
			"You seem to be loving a bit more than just yourself right now, dear. Do you want to do it right now..? I
			don't mind..."
		<p>
			She lowers herself onto the bed, the TV once again flickering in the background. It hadn't started working
			any better since moving it to the bedroom, either. She lies down, unbuttoning her blouse as Mania continues
			to touch her.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			“I'm not horny now, no. I'm just running my hands on you and seeing you squirm like a little, white roach
			under my damn self.”
		<p>
			She clambers over her chest and then squeezes her skin again in two places. She glides her nails along the
			surface. Her knees press against Maddie's calves.
		<p>
			“Look who respects me.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie's blush intensifies, her face turning bright red.
		<p>
			"You want me to squirm? Wh-why... and I do respect you, as a partner. Just because you've done some awful
			things doesn't mean you aren't a person, and I respect you a lot..."
		<p>
			She whimpers a bit as Mania touches across her body, trembling slightly. However, she enjoys every moment of
			this.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Mania_w">
		<p>
			----------------------------------
		<p>
			The elevator descends from Heaven. Mania lugs in her arms an impression of early 21st century Times Square
			drawn by the late Tiziano Vecellio, and she bumps Maddie's head by accident.
		<p>
			“Where should we hang this? Besides the water cooler?” Or the empty gallon drum, anyway.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"Oh, neat. That one's from the early 21st century! I really liked those years a lot. Vecillio did a great
			job with this one!"
		<p>
			Maddie walks over to the cooler, gently pushing it aside to make room for the painting.
		<p>
			"Yeah, this spot looks good. I think it'll be a nice addition to the apartment. Really livens it up a bit,
			you know?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Gideon_w">
		<div class="wrap Mania_w">
			<p>
				A chilly voice says, “This is an office building.”
			<p>
				Mania slides the painting onto the floor, and her hands pose like gnarled claws. She searches cubicle
				after cubicle, which causes a minority of imps to get back to their dull work.
			<p>
				“Who the Hell are you?”
			<p>
				“Gideon. You're correct to assume you're in trouble, Magdalena Neale. Colloquially Mania. There are
				Rules.”
			<p>
				A person stands in the hallway leading to the elevator. Their physical form could be seventeen years old
				or it could be seventy. They're holding a gray blob that shivers in their white gloves. They nod at
				Maddie when she stares. An imp grins by Gideon's knees, too.

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie stares at the figure, shock and worry on her face.
		<p>
			"G-Gideon? What are you doing here?"
		<p>
			Even with her limited knowledge of Hell, Maddie isn't clueless. Gideon is the overseer of Hell, and their
			presence here is most likely a dire issue.
		<p>
			Maddie detects a strange aura from Gideon. It's extremely powerful, but not demonic. It's clouded and
			obfuscated, making it impossible to determine what they truly are.
		<p>
			"Please don't harm her. I'm just trying to help her, please..."

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Gideon_w">
		<div class="wrap Mania_w">
			<p>
				Mania's voice lowers and she backs into a glass wall. The scenic view of crimson rock sprawls behind
				her.
			<p>
				“—Fuck. I didn't mean it, Gideon, whatever I did. I'll work you with you here. Level with me.”
			<p>
				The Demon of Fate walks toward Mania. They then appear in front of her without so much as a blur or
				whistle. They points backwards at the imp that came with them.
			<p>
				“Your imp of your servitude Jase Bush reported your visitations in Heaven. This reached me. Your Spatial
				Elevator Interference ability has a remarkable oversight. Kuma and then I were unaware of the
				infrastructure in Heaven permitting this loophole until Now. You abused it.”

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie continues to watch, her fears now confirmed.
		<p>
			"It's my fault! I was only trying to show her heaven so she'd finally let go... I just wanted to help get
			her out of here. Hasn't she suffered for long enough?"
		<p>
			Maddie gives Gideon a pleading look, deeply concerned for her friend and partner.

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Gideon_w">
		<div class="wrap Mania_w">
			<p>
				Gideon turns their attention to Maddie. Mania closes her eyes, and she cries while muttering swears. Her
				power and wealth are Chance cards and Monopoly money to Gideon.
			<p>
				“You're of Good Intention, Angel Maddie. Understand Magdalena understood her transgression and agreed to
				pursue it to a logical extreme. There are now consequences.”
			<p>
				The jiggling mass in their hands leaps up and assaults Mania's wrists and ankles, plummeting her to the
				floor. The four components condense into metal clamps that lock her free movement away. And Gideon
				teleports her elsewhere.
			<p>
				They continue, “You're an excellent Savior.”

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			"What? I'm doing a good job? You just shackled her and took her away! She's barely gotten anywhere with
			actually helping her, she's still arrogant and stubborn. I feel like I've failed in every regard."
		<p>
			Maddie looks sadly at where Mania used to be, tears in the corners of her eyes.
		<p>
			"How is this doing excellent? Will I even get to see her again?"

	</div>
	<div class="wrap Gideon_w">
		<p>
			“Her aura is weakening. Her confidence is shrinking. Her focus is shifting.”
		<p>
			Gideon presents Maddie another gray blob. It morphs into a common GPS and navigation instrument accurate to
			the millimeter. It registers Mania's location.
		<p>
			“She was once Unsalvageable.”

	</div>
	<div class="wrap HopefulMaddie_w">
		<p>
			Maddie's fear is now replaced with curiosity at Gideon's words.
		<p>
			"How do you know all of this? What even are you? You don't seem to be a demon..."
		<p>
			She takes the GPS, looking down at the screen intently.
		<p>
			"How long is she going to be there? I'm assuming I'm allowed to visit her, right? You wouldn't be giving me
			this if that wasn't the case."
