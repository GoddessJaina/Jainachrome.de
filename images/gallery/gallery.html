				<p> A skilled, tender interpretation of the mid-1800s Mania. My capitalist pig CEO of Hell has her
					roots in the Antebellum South. Stunning brushwork.

				<p> A lovely, warm depiction of the elegant and playful Goddess Jaina, my idealistic perceived self.
					This artist's renders of Patchouli Knowledge made me bite. The background is an empty Sudoku grid!

				<img src="/images/gallery/Vera.png" alt="Vera Hanley Commission">
				<p> This art from my friend in 2019 has been the wallpaper on my left monitor ever since. (Don't
					ask me what's on the right one.) Vera Hanley is reviewing her notes on her Town-issued tablet before
					going to bed. She's dressed in what she'd consider to be comfortable sleepwear or pajamas.
