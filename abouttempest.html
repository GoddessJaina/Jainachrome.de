		<h1>About Tempest</h1>
		<p>
		Tempest is, lightly put, the caretaker of Monochrome. An Agender, Ace, Aromantic being of darkness, ix/ix'/ixself. Pronounced as a rhyme to "hiss". Ix will largely be a fleeting presence at best, and generally prefers to only show a forward presentation when things require ix' interference. Not that this means it's a given that seeing Tempest's face or name spells terrible news. Especially if prompted by other Monochromes, perhaps because "it would be funny", Tempest will chime in on topics and does like helping when ix is suited to do so specifically.
		<p>
		Do not get on Tempest's bad side. This is a tough feat to achieve generally, but there is a slumbering fury inside this darkness and ix will as needed always put Monochrome's well-being over anything and anyone else.
