		<h1>Persuading a Prodigy</h1>
		<div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		The twin bells of the town's central tower ring in near-unison, and the wisps spray out from the windows below, and the clouds above are moody. Azriel Cromwell isn’t mayor, or the grand archmage, but all her training, surely, meant it is a matter of more years of meditative refinement of the auracraft for her to go from renowned instructor to legend.
		<p>
		She, though, needs to accompany this with a pretty shilling. And finally an offer that'd almost certainly shower her with fortune is at her hand. Miss Cromwell knocks the door of the manor, expecting the pompous and historically damning Whitmore family to all answer. She summons a wisp to brighten her caked face. 
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		After some small delay, the door slowly creaks open, and in its frame stands an equally aged woman adorned a quite fine butler's outfit. The visitor is eyed up and down, some degree of respect written into the else quite expressionless face. 
		<p>
		"Ah, Miss Cromwell, as expected. Please, follow me inside. The Whitmores are already in their office." She turns, leaning the way up the central staircase across from the entry hall, and then in a door just down the hall. As expected, a pair of people clearly marked as parents of a more than generously difficult child are seated at a table with a seat free opposite them. The father, greyed hair and scruffy voice, motions her to sit. 
		<p>
		"Welcome, Instructor Cromwell. I'm glad you could find the time for us. I hope the way here found you well."
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		Instructor Cromwell leaves a polite and hasty nod for the butler woman, and then she says to Mr. Whitmore, “Thank you. I'd be pleased to discuss the terms of agreement.” She sits in the free, opposing chair. And she folds her hands in her lap. The wisp highlighting her expression fades. “Your daughter's future is of my interest just as much as your own. And for that I request very favorable conditions. I'll elaborate if needed, only, however. What would you like to elaborate on concerning...  Lucina?” She clears her throat. The girl's name is Lucina. “Perhaps more importantly, what would be useful to know?”
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The mother chimes in, with a very vague plea in her tone. "Concerning is the right word, yes. She has... A habit of being quite stuck up in her talents. A formal in-class education was unsuccessful, and we have already seen a few tutors come and go. She will test your Instructor's prowess even more than your magical prowess, and that despite her being eerily talented in the arcane arts of light, as you should be informed of already. You're free to take notes of them for your own magical studies. We can give you generous pay and arrange for most material needs that this challenge might require; all we ask for is that you manage to set her on the proper path of education and control. She is as much a hazard as a talent in her unrefined state."
		<p>
		The husband continues. "We are unfortunately very busy people, and you'll largely be left to your own reins during the tutoring. We only care for general progress and for Lucina to remain a happy and optimistic child, we have no hard expectations of a set curriculum or classical educational methods as those haven't proved fruitful at all. Do what you deem appropriate, as long as it works and does her well. There will always be house staff present in case of any immediate needs, you'll be allowed to call on them for assistance of any reasonable means."
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		Instructor Cromwell nods, keeping a mental catalog on the list of expectations. She's been hired for her success stories, and she understood failing this prodigy and these sorry parents would not only mean failing all the pay, time, resources, and private rooms lent to her, but failing  her exploding reputation as an instructor. And the girl's intrinsic affinity for light aura-wielding is something that could be, well, legendary too. For her and Miss Cromwell. She says, “You meet rowdy candidates in the studious realm of the arcane, and soon enough they're cut of their rose thorns. I'm sure Lucina and I can come to an agreement that progressing her abilities is simply more desirable for every sorcerer here, her included... I'll be firm, though. There is time for dinner, there is time for her laughter, there is time for her study and practice.” She's been of immaculate posture this whole time. Only now she leans forward. “With the generous resources, pay, and the manor at large, the study and practice in particular should be totally, utterly meditative.”
		<p>
		Her earrings bounce once. “When should I be introduced to Lucina? Will I have a guest room for my late evenings and quiet afternoon in this otherwise lengthy 1-on-1 tutoring series?”
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The instructor's knowledgeable words and experienced optimism manages to spark visible hope in both the Whitmores. "I am certain that we finally picked the right person for the task, surely. It isn't a secret to any of us here, of course, that leading her on a path of skill and not just talent could spell an astounding future for her." The lady sighs, and nods at the comment of wealth and resources. "We're aware that the money is likely a great part of the draw and motivation here and will supply as demanded, but do also keep in mind the more abstract value of all this. She could become a shining star in many respects, and you'll surely be a part of her legacy if you do well. And, well... The Whitmore legacy would do with the lift as well. It'd be a favor to all of us- Lucy! You should come say hi." 
		<p>
		There's no response, just some rustling at the door. By the time Miss Cromwell has a chance to turn around, only a brief look of the young lady's face past the doorframe as she peeks in on the conversation is offered before she scurries down the hall again.
		<p>
		"...We'll arrange for you to meet soon enough, I suppose. She knows you're an instructor so she might be disapproving of your presence at first.", the scruffy voice tones again. "We can provide a guest room between all weekdays; for the weekends we cannot guarantee this and I do suspect you wouldn't want to stay here on a permanent basis anyhow. Rumor has it you're a very busy woman."
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		Instructor Cromwell smirks at shadow of the nimble soon-to-be student. “Yes, I'll meet her in proper then. Anyway, I'm overjoyed to take weekdays here and weekends to outside endeavors. I'll be an inevitable presence in her day, so I'll insist to Lucina that she finds peace to my company.” She sits back in her seat once more, and she's taller than minutes ago. She rests clenches her dominant hand against the edge of the table. “I've thought on legacy plenty, your daughter being no exception. I'm very pleased you're elated about what it'll mean for the Whitmores. I suspect it'll pave the way in my future. We all could follow if she studies the arcane light further than anyone before.”
		</div><div class="vl"><p>
		The husband simply nods along sagely; it'd be wonderful to get that far, but even just progressing Lucy along somewhat would be great to start. "Very well. I don't think there's much reason to delay, so you can come by already tomorrow and we'll introduce you. Feel free to already take some belonging you'd want here along with you." He gets up, as if he's eager to end the conversation before Azriel has a chance to reconsider. "Thank you, so very much."
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		“Thank you, likewise, for this once in a lifetime opportunity, Mr. Whitmore. I won't be needing anything stolen out of the home; however, I appreciate it.” She stands up after speaking, and she checks her mental catalog if she's covered the necessary bases to the parents. And it seems so. She takes to offering him a handshake, and one for the mother as well. And she exits the home with shrouding her appearance in a veil of darkness, reserving her appearance from a collection of just-passing families just outside the manor. She's even worked with one of them.
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		--------------------
		<br>
		It's the day after, and Lucina is sat in waiting in one of the meeting rooms with her legs tucked onto her chair and a hot tea in hand. Her mother would have complained that she ought to sit properly, but even just getting her to be present and presentable for a tutor is a success in its own right so trying to improve on that is unnecessary risk. Little Miss Lucy had been a bit more willing than the last two times to attend, but still made some fuss in the process. Her mind wanders in her half-hearted patience, and she doesn't react to the sound of someone sounding at the door. 
		<p>
		She feels a slight bit different about Cromwell than the last few tutors even just from the small bit of observation she caught the day before, but she can't quite find out why.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		Instructor Cromwell walks into the room and closes the door behind her without ever moving a finger. She similarly sits in a chair which slides a bit forward after just across from Lucina. Perhaps Lucina just needed someone to show a generous usage of magic to spice the mundane. It sometimes does the trick, anyway. She's wearing a lovely purple set, and her dark hair has been done up in a casual, messy bun.
		<p>
		She smiles at Lucina. And she says, without compromising her adult air, "Hello. I really look forward to working together with you, Miss Lucina, but today I'd like us to get to know one another. And let's keep it relaxed. Do you happen to already know my surname?"
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		Lucina watches the display with measured amounts of interest, tucking her legs in just a little more and taking a few sips of her drink. "Mom and Dad have hyped you up a fair bit, Miss Cromwell, but they've kind of done that every time there's been a new instructor. It's always the same really. Did they tell you, you're the seventh in line?" Her eyes, however, stick on Azriel more than they've usually done on the instructors. Is it really always the same? Who knows. Lucina is ready to be impressed. 
		<p>
		Lucina, today, is clad in fairly modest but comfortable housewear attire, though due to her family's standards it's more than fancy enough to count as a presentable. Again, having her actually attend this meeting was more a priority.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		"Ah, wonderful. I do have a most prestigious list of private tutoring successes, so I can't blame their excitement. I insist this won't be the same, however. Seven is an excellent number. It's the amount of schools of arcane arts, after all." She watches Lucina sip from her drink, and she puts her hands up on the table. Her manicured thumbs toying with one another. "How do you spend your time, Lucina? Something of an obsession with magic twiddling, or do you find yourself dabbling in other interests and affairs?"
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		Lucina can't help but chuckle. With the amount of fresh starts to education she's had, she's been through the very generic details of magic so, so many times. "Yeah, yeah, schools of magic. Cryo. Pyro. Geo. Aether. Mortis. Vitae... Lumes. I know." The fancy nails do catch her attention as well, though. "I like dabbling in my talents but dad always complains that I'm making a mess or being reckless or such. So I keep it somewhat limited. I do also like reading, and I practice Arcanum quite a bit. Y'know, the board game. Dad says I'm really good at it! If the whole magic thing falls through due to a lack of instructors I could make my name playing that competitively instead." She puts her legs down and pulls the chair close enough to the table that she can put her cup down before tucking in her legs up again.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		Instructor Cromwell tilts her head and says, "Yeah, I figured you know. My point was just the cardinality of your amount of instructors now matches the cardinality of the schools." She nods somewhat, and she fidgets a bit in her chair at Lucina's mention of excelling at Arcanum. As it would have it, the magic thing won't fall through if she's the one teaching. At least, if it did, Instructor Cromwell could kiss her perfect reputation goodbye. She smiles. "Your excellence in the old game should prove valuable in the breed of clever strategies and complex conjurations found only in the arcane... So, the best instruction of inner talent will often involve 'messes' being made, especially when placing your first spells and, much later, your largest spells ever. I'll ensure we have space to work with."
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		"Beh. I can very well avoid a mess as much as make one." She turns her not entirely empty cup of tea upside down, but no spill is made. Judging from the slight glint of frosted humidity along the bottom of the cup, it's fair to assume the contents are frozen in place... And then, a small crunching noise, as the expanding liquid makes the ceramic most subtly crack under the pressure. Lucina eeps ever so gently, partially because she knows her parents will complain again if they find out and partially because she definitely botched her snarky presentation of magic.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		"We'll have time to impress me soon. I will say, though, you've managed to both not make a mess and make a mess at the same." Instructor Cromwell gestures some fingers at the ceramic cup, and she slides it outside Lucina's grasp. She continues, "When we begin proper lessons next time, and we have a comfortable space to practice the arcane, I encourage you to impress me. We'll work from there." She faces Lucina, and she leans forward against the table. "As hard as it might be to believe, although I come from a background of allegedly formal education, fine-tuning your use of the arcane arts often comes in many, less formal sittings. And even if you know the books on beginner's conjurations, the fine-tuning is always a bit of homework. And for us, thankfully quite the focus."
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		Lucina instinctively reaches after the cup as it escapes her, but realizes that she's not in charge of what happens to it any more. "Could... You fix it, somehow? I don't want dad to be annoyed again. ...Please?" Her ego has visibly taken as much a crack as the cup has, and she pouts cutely. A bit of a habit she has from trying to gain pity from the mansion staff in similar situations. 
		<p>
		As Azriel leans in, however, something in Lucina's brain whirrs. Something about this woman's mannerisms is certainly different from what Lucy is used to. She has the air of a proper and fancy instructor but she is just not by the books.
		<p>
		Also, Lucy feels vaguely warm. She doesn't realize her cheeks reflect this ever so subtly. "Very well, Miss. I'll... See what I can do, then. Would you want to see the... Light, when we do? Everyone loses their mind over it, for some reason. I don't get it. Everyone tells me I'm unrefined and in need of learning when I can so clearly do things they can't."
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		Instructor Cromwell smiles a thin smile at the pout, finding it difficult to pity from all her time with prior students whining and pouting. She finds the pouting from Lucina more, well, adorable. "I don't want to fix it, and I'll just inform your father the simple matter of what happened. It's merely peas to complain about compared to the exciting developments of the week ahead to be enchanted about. Indeed, we have later for parlor tricks, absolutely." She doesn't take much notice of the cheeks, even though Lucina is pale. Being flustered is quite normal. She taps her own chin, considering the impressive Lumes arcane art to be had. "Actually, Lucina, I think we'd do well to start with your ice magic. The work with light is very unusual, certainly, in how uncommon and relatively new it is to be wielded. And precisely because of that I think your work with the arcane school of Cryo will serve us better to start fine-tuning first. I specialize in Pyro, however Cryo is among my strongest schools." 
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		Lucina reads this a clear challenge for her to behave and do well for the next time. Well played, Miss Cromwell, she has to concede. "Pyro... You wouldn't know how many times the parents have counted their blessings for that not being on my list of innate talents. So... No Light for now? That's. Odd. You're sure? Everyone usually wants to see it. But I'll take your lead. For now." She raises her hand and some snowflakes materialize in the air around it, slowly drifting down. It's a very minor amount, since she's well versed in how much effort it is to dry off a proper indoor snowfall. "So, when do we start? Do I need yet another edition of Visualizing Invocations? I have three of them already. They keep updating it, and my family doesn't hesitate to get the most up to date content."
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		"I'm quite sure. My patience might measure favorably compared to your prior instructors from the sounds of it. I'm sure they enjoyed the early spectacle, however." She glances at the snowflakes, and she pushes back her chair slowly so as to stand up. "Tomorrow at the stroke of noon. We'll have lunch together with your parents about thirty minutes before that, so be ready for that as well... I think we've talked a good deal for now, and I've covered everything I wanted to know for now as your instructor. And, no, I won't be giving you another edition of that. Just reuse the latest edition for formal references when I might request any. Did you have any questions before I meet with your parents once more and then depart for my evening?"
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		"Noon sounds... Late. Compared to what I'm used to." She smiles softly. "I like it. I think I don't have much else to mention right now, though? I'll have to see how things... Develop, first." Lucina gets up onto her feet ahead of Azriel, indicating that she's just as much in agreement about the meeting being over for now. 
		<p>
		There's a small thud from inside the cup as the still frozen tea has thawed just enough to loosen from the ceramic and fall to the table.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		--------------------
		<br>
		Ms. Cromwell spent time her evening practicing, once more, from her assorted, familiar conjurations beyond and including Cryo. The list of spells is like a series of enchanted stretches, each verifying the integrity of her knowledge, focus, and reflex in the arcane schools. Setting several flames adrift around her, freezing a lengthy band of mist, clumping together clay from her desk and tossing them back as stone, growing a leaf from a potted plant into a thorny tangle. And, as she completed this routine, outside her window, there was a fire outside somewhere on the forested outskirts of the town. And she could hear the dissent of those who lived there, unprotected from even hooligans by anything less than some archaic government social programs.
		<p>
		She sits opposite of Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore, slicing her portion of the slab of pork from the table center and resting it to a plate. "Thank you," the instructor says. "Have you heard the unfortunate news of the death this morning of the younger fabric worker?"
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		Lucina hasn't slept too awfully well, and is quite thankful that there was nothing planned for early this morning. She chews on a bit of smeared toast; while her gaze rests in the direction of Ms. Cromwell, it's clear she's an entirely unknowing person when it comes to societal and political issues. It's always been trying to deal with magic, with and about her. She yawns slightly, trying to hide her face as best she can. 
		<p>
		"I did hear that something of the sorts happened, past that I'm still waiting on more official reports. People say and accuse so much in these incidents." Mr. Whitmore helps himself to some beans. "Unfortunate indeed."
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		She says, "The reports seem a bit leisurely in coming out to the public. I'd think a tragedy of a beloved business' son would be more pressing. Although, I'm sure there's a lot of moving parts involved." She smirks, somehow, and eats. Her plate is also complemented with vegetables and a glass of sparkling water. "I've been thinking about what I'd enact in a position like Great Archmage, and who I'd elect for the position this biannual that shares my thoughts."
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		"You'd have my vote, Ms. Cromwell. You seem to have the aspirations and commitment to do great things. I hope the meal is to your liking." Mrs. Whitmore passes some potatoes to Lucina. A request, not an offer. Lucina takes a minor amount, just enough to not be judged.
		<p>
		"Yeah, that's bureaucracy for you. It's all wrapped up and complicated, you'd think they'd streamline things by now but no. It's good at least they try to keep things disclosed until details are more certain... We do have personal experience with the public getting caught up in things that are entirely not true." Mr. Whitmore chews some meat, and gets a look from his wife about not finishing his bites before speaking.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		She tilts her chin back for the sparkling water. Then she says, "I am rather inspired and love our city. Perhaps, with your vote and advocacy as a fragrant start, I will run for the office." She smiles, and she takes it to Lucina. "Still, it's easy to just excuse something just because it's complicated to get right. On that subject, Lucina and I will not be shying from the farther teachings of Cryo someday soon. Has a proper area of the manor been cleared for her and I to study and train?"
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		"In the west wing, we have a study and a meeting room set aside. The study is... Mostly cleared, so there's very few expensive things to be wary of there. The connected meeting room is properly furnished with seating and tables, books and other supplies. We are, as stated, eager to supply anything more as needed. I would suggest keeping the magic to the study, if possible. Miriam will show you the way once you're ready." The lady that had let Ms. Cromwell in on both occasions bows slightly in acknowledgement of being mentioned by Mrs. Whitmore. 
		<p>
		"Yes, mom, I'll try not to destroy seven copies of textbooks at once again. Now please, can we get over that incident?" Lucina rolls her eyes, and grumbles into another mouthful of toast. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		"Excellent. We'll definitely require new materials as the studies continue, which materials left unknown for the time being... the basic equipment is certainly all in place. And I am almost ready, speaking on that." Instructor Cromwell picks at her plate, appropriately, and she nods at Miriam. Then she quietly laughs at Lucina's annoyance, the way her eyes roll. The instructor completes her meal and leaves the lunch table with the company of Lucina to the west wing.
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		Upon the notion of leaving, Lucy shovels down the last third of her toast and stands up as well. She could run ahead as she's well familiar with the rooms, but Miriam at least gets the respect of getting to lead the two there. The door opens, to a startlingly large and more notably, tall room. It's certainly more than what one would assume by the word 'study'. "Call for me if there's anything more you need, Ms. Cromwell." She takes a bow and leaves, and Lucina takes spot in the middle of the room, stretching out quite impressively. Going from bed to lunch table hasn't given her much time to displace her limbs.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		"Thank you, Miriam, for your assistance." Azriel walks in a large revolution around Lucina, admiring the architecture of the study. It's the most promising site of training yet for a pupil. She then closes the gap, ending the circling like a shark, and stands beside Lucina. She says, "Well, we've finally gotten through the paperwork and the padding. Again, I'll be your Instructor Cromwell for the foreseeable future. And we should begin with some focused demonstrations of your existing Cryo abilities." She produces a few floating beads of water and strings them in front of Lucina, before dropping them to the white tile. "Almost all Cryo sorcery relies on tailoring water from a liquid source or the very air, and this air is hardly dry. Could you, today and now, pool water for me?"
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		Lucina sits down on the floor, and observes the water droplets that have splashed onto the tiles. "Incanter's Tips and Tricks #17, don't dismiss an already existing source of water if present." She waves her hands over the splatters and they slowly coalesce into - Not an orb of water, as it slowly but certainly freezes over and turns into a lump of ice, snow settling in the air around it. It's clear that, unlike most scholars and apprentices, the magic is deeply innate and quite potent - she can't measure it down to only the control of water for now. "Uh... Close enough?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		The Instructor kneels down and hovers her hand over the new ice but not in direct contact with it. And she recedes her hand to feel the small bits of snow melt into her skin. She says, "So you've tailored water successfully, even suspending it from the floor, but you've also inadvertently frozen it. While it will often be the goal to freeze the water, we'll definitely want to investigate having a fine-tuned control of specifically the liquid stage. Since you'd be able to achieve things like, for example, this." She coalesces water again from the air, this time from a couple feet away to not disturb the ball of ice. She gathers enough of it to twirl into a column in front of them, and then she freezes it and permits gravity its part. The spire of crystalized water stands upright to the height of the sat Lucina's shoulders. 
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		"Hmm... You do have a point. This happens with all instructors, really. They're so used to helping people do more magic that actually dealing with prodigies is outside of their skillset. A young girl isn't meant to be able to just, accidentally freeze things!" She rolls her orb away, and with a crackle it bursts into small pieces so that it may melt and return its humidity to the air sooner. And she focuses again, trying to focus on the mannerisms that Azriel had been using. She makes a small glob of water, and takes a deep breath as she tries to clear her mind and impulses of the desire to beset it with a deep cold on instinct. It does last for some time, but as soon as she tries reshaping it the focus is lost and it freezes into the shape of a lumpy icicle. "It's like the natural state of water in my control is ice. I intend to freeze it after shaping it, after all, so the magic just skips ahead to that part." Lucy grumbles gently.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		Instructor Cromwell pupils follow the rolling ball of ice, and she smirks. She returns her attention to the botched attempt at shaping a "water tower," and she says, "That is a difference between them and I. In this situation, I have no concern of what you're meant or not meant to know up to and including this point. Instead, I'm just focusing on the gaps in moving forward. And cut yourself some slack, you're more of a young woman." A small circle of flames  appears at the base of both Lucina's icicle and the instructor's icicle, each melting them with unnatural pace. The instructor moves to the side and demonstrates a formation of water into a simple torus just off the ground. Her hands operate the spell with great luxury. “There's a few ways you could think of water. Its natural state could be ice and you could just 'convince the magic' that other states of water have a place in the natural world as well. Alternately, you could try to mentally abandon the idea of a natural state. Some great sorcerers, after all, subscribe to the idea that modern incantations are purely unnatural.”
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		Lucina attends to the suggestions with great interest, and seems to fall quiet, thoughtful. It's true, this is not nearly the kind of pointers she's usually told. And it makes sense, to some extent. She was always so focused in the idea of turning water into ice, or not turning water into ice...
		<p>
		She focuses again, manifesting a glob of water. As she stretches and shapes it cautiously, it makes the vaguest hints of crystallizing but she focuses on simply turning the ice back into water - It works at first, but the collective temperature of the mass drains towards freezing inevitably. As she tries to shape it into a loop, it ices over; she can't convert it to water again with her ice magic, but. What if she- 
		<p>
		There's a bright flash inside the water as Lucina's instincts try to apply her capacity of Lumes to reheat the water, which only serves to blind her temporarily as she was staring deeply into the water at the moment. The ring shatters on the floor as her focus is broken, and she rubs her eyes unhappily followed by soft, complainy noises.
		</div><div class="wrap Azriel_w"><p>
		“Yes. You're sustaining the state of water much longer now.” Azriel saunters around the ring, examining Lucina's expression and hand motions. Then she stumbles backwards at the burst of light between and below them, and a healthy splash of the water lands on her shoes. The instructor flinches and blinks.
		<p>
		“Hold on, Lucina, hold on. Please. Was the incorporation of Lumes intentional? You're incredibly potent in that school—we both recognize that from all the earlier discussion and rumors; however, if it was intentional, why would you try to incorporate it for this practice of molding water..?” Cromwell stands beside Lucina. She hides her shock in seeing the young woman's gift in the Lumes arts not only unpracticed but in trail of an entirely unrelated conjuration. She puts her fingers over her own lips. Her eyes rest a bit lighter, though. “It's a genuine question, not a criticism.”
		</div><div class="wrap Lucina_w"><p>
		It takes another minute for Lucina to shake off the worst of her self-applied shock, and finally shakes herself through once to regain at least some composure. "Well, you see... I decided to focus on turning the forming ice back into water by using the warmth of the water around it. But, of course, eventually I ran out of warmth and it all froze at once! So the idea of heating it came to mind but I have no experience in Pyro because, well, obviously no one wants to teach me while my abilities are this volatile... And then I briefly related warmth and light and decided in the moment to use light to warm it up. Which was a stupid idea, probably. Pure Lumes isn't even warm at all, I know that from experience."
		<p>
		She rubs her eyes some more, and stands up as the water is starting to seep into some of her clothes. She seems a bit shaky, still. "I simply tried to think differently and I guess I achieved that, somehow. Turning ice back into water by itself is not sustainable, I see, but. That felt different. I guess there's really something to your ideas... I'll have to think about it. Thank you. Was this room always this dark?" She blinks a few more times.

		“You're quite skilled at explaining your thought process. That'll be quite useful... I don't think the idea was stupid. I would say the idea in using light to warm the object of water was a decision made in pressure, and there wasn't any pressure to act in this lesson. In other words, you're allowed to let the water turn into ice if it won't hold. We just want to keep extending the time until we suspect you can preserve water in an indefinite fluid state. Nobody would expect you to master this all at once.” She evaporates a large portion of the water into the air with some flicking gestures. She smiles. “I didn't know Lumes had a temperature. No matter, though. I'm glad you achieved something different, and I definitely encourage you, Lucina, to continue thinking on it long after our lesson. For now, though, let's try to keep Lumes out of our lessons in Cryo. Lone Cryo should be more approachable to refine for us considering, for instance, I have minimal experience in Lumes. And no, the room isn't any darker at all.”

		She stays beside Lucina, extends her hand, and says, “Should you need something before we continue practicing?”
