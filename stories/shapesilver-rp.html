		<h1>Shape and Silver — 1</h1>
		<div class="wrap Jaina_w"><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Shape pours the Earl Grey tea into a second cup that he also requested at the Cafe register. Vera Hanley takes a sip from this cup, glaring at Shape's brown eyes with her own blue ones. And then she snaps her eyes shut and pushes the cup aside, almost tipping it. "Shape, this Earl Grey beverage tastes like asphalt and tap water mixed by a barista. It's not good." Shape laughs and drinks his own tea, still smirking sometimes, and he plants his feet on the floor as a new woman walks into the Cafe that he's never seen in the town before. Vera jots about the horrendous ordeal caffeine products continue to be on her notetaking device, and she jitters on the back of her chair as if the caffeine is already affecting her. It hasn't. Shape is a bit shameless in peeking looks at the new woman when she's even looking his way by chance. 
		</div></div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver's eyes quickly scan the locale as she enters the Café for the first time. She needs to know what she's working with - A rather cozy establishment, it seems. Not too populated at this time of the day, but a possible couple seem to be having a moment with each other. The girl doesn't like the drink, that's clear. Silver takes a note to order something that isn't tea for now. The table next to the two is free for now. If nothing else? Silver might be able to pick up on their conversation for valuable information. 
		<p>
		Her loose, silver-shiny hair that she prides herself with has taken a toll from the not too mild wind outside, and she takes a moment to settle it back into place before approaching the register. "A large cup of hot chocolate, please, add some caramel to it and be generous with the cream. Make that as extra as you like, I won't mind the price." The entire request takes but a moment, and before she can receive any response, she's sat down at the previously chosen table, leaving behind a more than adequate amount of coins on the counter. She's in visible proximity of Shape and Vera now, offering occasional glances both that way and to the rest of the visitors in equal parts. 
		<p>
		Assessing a new place and establishing a suitable reputation is always an effort but she knows it will pay off in the long run.
		</div><div  class="wrap Jaina_w"><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		The hair isn't quite bleached, but it doesn't seem quite dyed, does it? Vera now glances toward the newcomer, following Shape's lead, although it's less boredom and more business. Shape is happy to meet people, sure, and a mysterious, alone woman sitting next to them is a great opportunity. Vera just thinks Shape wants to have sex, which might also be a factor Shape's considering anyway. She pushes her chair back from her dull, white flats, and Shape waves her down while clenching his teeth. He says, "Vera, Christ, can you not do that right now?" But Vera already begins her typical procedure. The smell of the hot chocolate being made and presented on the cafe counter and the bright sun shining on her pale lips make her especially bouncy this morning, like a waitress. "Hello. I do not mean to bother you, but I am a journalist and I was hoping to gather 'the next scoop' on our locals." Her voice fades for a moment. "What is your name? Please, call me Blogger." Shape approaches beside Vera and tugs her elbow. She ignores him.
		</div></div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		So the girl is called Vera, or "Blogger", and also quite the nosy kind. Not exactly what Silver was hoping for, but she can't make a scene this early in her presence. So she'll humor Vera for now. Her companion seems a bit more reasonable, maybe he'll help keep Vera in line for now. She seems awfully in a good mood today, who knows how long that will last.
		<p>
		Silver takes just a bit of time to fetch her drink, stir it counter clockwise exactly twice and then have a spoonful of cream for herself. Don't let your air of importance falter, but also don't be rude. 
		<p>
		"A journalist, hm? I didn't quite take you for one but they come in all shapes and sizes these days. You may call me Silver, Vera." She doesn't want to humor Vera too much, make her too comfortable. So calling her 'Blogger' isn't happening. "Who's this friend of yours, if I may ask? He seems to object to you disturbing others' peace before they have a chance to settle."
		</div><div  class="wrap Jaina_w"><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera sighs and adjusts her sash component of her utilitarian dress. "I will call you Silver. I am unsure why you call me 'Vera,' however." Shape can't help but to snort, and he looks to Silver as if he were saying, "Can you believe this?" Up-playing the absurdity of Vera's investigative nature, Shape hoped, would put Silver and him on pretty good terms--light-hearted and fun. Vera continues, "He's hardly my friend. Don't mind him... His name is Shape. Now-- Silver, are you a visitor or a local? What have you enjoyed so far about our city? Are you employed, and if so, what's your occupation?" She has the faintest hint of a smile when she dismisses Shape, and it carries. Shape tugs her aside a few inches and says, bluntly, "Vera, what the hell. What if I wanted to talk to her instead, huh? Interview her later."
		</div></div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Dear god, she is proving quite a bit more tedious than already anticipated. Silver will probably entertain her with some spun up cover story once she's familiar enough with this place to offer a believable tale but for now? She's just not ready for this. Shape seems to be much more interesting and is clearly eager to talk. She taps her temple in annoyance and sighs loudly. Her eyes turn to Vera's; when she speaks, there's a gentle static to the air around the three of them.
		<p>
		"Shape is right, Vera. We can have this conversation some other time. Please, pack your things and leave for now." It's not a request. It's an order, and not one that's easy to refuse. Silver's Tongue is not something she is at all happy to use here, but who knows how much of a scene this will turn out to be if she doesn't interfere now. She has a reputation to keep in order.
		</div><div  class="wrap Jaina_w"><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Shape rubs his ear. Did he blow it out earlier with loud music? Well-- no, not for many years as he blared music in his ears like that. However, to Shape's amazement, as Vera grabs her notetaking device from her satchel idly while listening to Silver's directed request, Vera blinks, shakes her head lightly, and then writes Silver's name and an unhappy break in the page as she leaves through the front entrance of the Cafe. Shape would have at least expected Vera to say a formal goodbye-- after, of course, asking for her contact information for questioning in the future to be just about guaranteed assuming that Silver would ever use her phone line. But nothing happened. Vera simply left. Shape sits across from Silver and apologizes on their behalf, taking off his glasses to rub them with a cleaner and wipe in his pocket. "She's a very strange woman, seriously, I'm really sorry about that. I don't know how you convinced her to back off, but I'll take it. So, uh, you had some interest in me, I take it? I did, well, hope you were going to, if I'm being honest. I need a bit of a break from... Vera, for instance." He places his rectangular glasses back on and smiles. 
		</div></div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver doesn't even care to look after Vera as she leaves the building. There's at the very least an hour or two until Vera might even consider coming back, despite how gentle Silver was with the affect to keep it more... inconspicuous. Too much would probably just have scared off Shape too, but he seems to have taken it with a good bit of obliviousness. Her gentle grey-blue eyes trail across his face to take in the detail as the shifting of his glasses gives him an excuse too, but she has to blink away some residual convincing energy from her eyes noticing that the shared gaze has a slight tingly spark to it. 
		<p>
		She takes a sip of her hot chocolate, visibly more relaxed now that she's no longer being pestered for all of her personal details. "Oh, you certainly are more interesting than Little Miss Blogger, as she calls herself. So, you go by Shape? Hm, I won't pry as to the details or you'll just want to pry in return. I'm new here as you might tell, and... I hope this place proves to be more positively eventful than-" She waves a gesture towards the door. "That. I'll have to deal with her some other time, she didn't look too pleased. You, however... I take it you are more familiar with the surroundings. Any insights you can offer me about this area? I may have intents to stay here for longer."
		<p>
		A lot of exposition for such a simple question, but anything to drown out Shape's confusion over Vera does well right now so she's feeling rather talkative.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape nods as Vera is teased behind her back once more. He gets up for a moment to retrieve the two cups of Earl Grey, sipping from his in a reflection of the moment Silver sips. Certainly he could try to match her deliberate pacing. He says, "Yeah, I go by Shape. We can pry each other for details if you want some other time. Or later tonight." Shape bows at the entrance, smirking. He then returns to form. "Yeah, I've been here several years and all. So basically here we have a lovely bar and a few good family diners. Thankfully they've pushed the fast food and superstores back a bit from the local businesses, but I suspect it won't last forever, especially as my side of the town is getting a pretty huge expansion soon. We have an old train station that's pretty historical. I dunno. I'm mostly here because it's quaint and it's quiet. Do you have a hotel reserved for the night or a friend lives here?" Shape sips from his drink again and holds up Vera's cup as if inspecting it would shed context on the morning. He checks his phone for messages and sends Vera one, then discards his phone into his pocket as quickly as it came. Eye contact.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Later tonight, hmm? You seem to have high hopes for today, but I'm not busy at all today so who knows~?" She ponders her words for a bit, idly stirring. Clockwise this time. "I've settled in at the more adequate of the hotels this place provides, but I've got some properties I'm eyeing up to possibly settle in."
		<p>
		Silver is visibly taking mental note of every bit of description Shape offers her. The mention of a local expansion elicits a small frown, but she quickly shrugs it off. "You'll have to introduce me to these places sometimes, I like taking advice from locals. Especially ones who have a taste in style." She eyes him up and down deliberately for emphasis. He's certainly adequately cute for her tastes.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"I'm never really busy. Sometimes I work part-time at a bookstore downtown, but you can usually catch me free," Shape says. He empties his drink and folds his hands on the table again. "West side? I'd be happy to have a new neighbor, if it turns out that way! Even if you are sort of mysterious." No more than he is, Shape supposes. He smiles. "Style? I promise I can dress so much more nicely than this, I just didn't expect to meet a lovely new woman is all." He wiggles his eyebrows. He ignores his phone buzzing in his pocket. "We'd probably want to start by taking a tour downtown, if you care for the cute little shops too, if you want me to introduce you as you say."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Mmm, that's good to know. I have honestly a bit too much free time these days, so finding someone to spend that time with in a new location is a priority of mine. I might settle into the west side, though a bit more out of the way. There's a lovely little mansion there currently for... sale." It's technically for lease, but Silver knows that some deliberate negotiation and a good sum of money will get her the property. "A lovely woman, you say?" She giggles slightly at the eyebrow wiggle her way. "You flatter me, dear. I think I'd be glad to spend the day together if you wish, whether you care to show me around or simply keep chatting." She's taken the spoon out of her cup, licking it off with just a bit of elegant emphasis, and then takes several sips of her chocolate.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Anybody who has too much free time and too much money is probably hiding something malicious, Shape's discovered in the past several years. Something, for sure, was unusual about Silver. Shape, however, wouldn't want to turn down a woman who licks a spoon like that. It's been a few weeks since something this exciting came at his feet. And so what if she's, like, a succubus? Shape blinks, realizing he's been staring at her licking the spoon and sipping the chocolate, and clears his throat. "Oh, I'd love to keep chatting as well. That'll happen regardless. But, Silver, I can't help but ask for one detail about your personal life, and I'm very sorry I have to ask." He puts his hand on her elbow for a moment, then he slowly retracts it and nods. "Are you single? Or even just looking for an affair? Because that's kind of where my mind's been, if I'm being honest. Being eighteen and bored has that sort of effect. Romance is lousy." He handles the spoon from Silver's side of the table.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver visibly has to refrain from a messy chuckle while in the middle of taking a sip. There was a nature about the boy, she'd sensed that, but this caught even her off guard. She sets the cup down, and recollects her posture and reaches over to fluff his hair. "You're a cute one, my dear Shape. Don't worry, I'm used to people falling for me and I love to humor them, but usually they are rarely this direct. Sometimes I have to elicit it out of people when it's already more than obvious." Her smile has warmed up noticeably at all this. "I'd gladly spend the night, not just the day. We can see after that."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Her formal speech mannerisms are a bit enticing. Most people aren't nearly this elegant. And even if Shape fails to reflect that sort of elegance, Shape enjoys the type. He sighs and scoots his seat closer to Silver by wrapping it around the corner of the table. "Yeah. That one kind of left my lips I guess, but honestly it's pretty deliberate. I have experience, and I figure it's not worth wasting time with interesting people if I know what we want." After all, she might end up disliking Shape in a matter of weeks. He touches her arm. "Thank you, Silver. I'd of course love to spend the night with you too. Would you prefer my place or the hotel room? Although, well, I guess it's only 10 AM. Would you like downtown still, or should we meet again tonight?" 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Not wasting time, you say?" She leans in and gives Shape a not at all vague kiss on the lips. "I can appreciate your ways, Shape. Some people end up being so much work for me. I'd love to go for a bit of a walk, dear. I still have so much day to fill, I see no reason to dismiss you so soon. And I do think your house would be better suited, I'm mostly just storing things in my room right now." 
		<p>
		She swiftly finishes her drink, carefully wiping her lips with a napkin. Not too satisfied with a look in her pocket mirror, she carefully reapplies her silvery lipstick. Yes, Shape got some of it on him, his lips are just gently sparkly now.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape closes his eyes and enjoys the moment all too late--it's almost over before he's able to settle from the surprise. He crosses his legs together for a moment and gasps, "Wow, I can appreciate that too, Silver, holy shit." And as soon as he's able to get out of his seat without a stiffy in his athletic shorts, Shape sidesteps to Silver's side and offers his hand to raise her out of her seat. "I'd love to show you the city... Shining, shimmering, splendid. Sorry. But yeah. It's a pretty little place."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		She knows. She's experienced in horny young men and he's playing it off well but not nearly well enough for her. She'll humor him though, takes his hand and gets out of her seat without mentioning anything. "Lead the way, darling. You're the guide." 
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		----------------------------------------
		<br>
		Fortunately, Shape didn't have to walk with Silver farther than the block for something more interesting than a bookstore or knickknack shop. Booths with pastel, plastic sheet walls and PVC tube supports lined the road, a whole section of downtown barred to vehicles today. Shape says, as he reads a store sign that flaps in the wind picking up, “I think a look around this would be up our alley. At least, I like to look at art I don't want to pay for." He pinches up a painted glass bird under one booth. It weighs nothing. "There was an especially nice wave painting I almost got a couple years ago here. Not sure why, in retrospect, though. I mean, it's not like I have any experience on the open ocean, I guess. It just looked nice."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver gazes across the somewhat unexpected expanse of vivid. Not an unpleased gaze, though. "Considering I have recently moved here, I could consider acquiring some arts for my upcoming new residence. With the prices offered, I'm sure the interior will be bare-bones." She eyes the bird being handled. Always good to know that Shape has a delicate touch when needed, despite seeming a bit of a bumbling kind at times. "If there's anything you find especially nice this time, do note it. I might be in a more generous mood today." 
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Hey, thanks, Silver. But, yeah, only within reason. I'd like to return the favor sometime, if you did that. That'd be the right thing to do." He blinks at the bird, setting it back onto the shelf. He faces his back to the shop owner. "I mean, those were cute, all the glass things, but they weren't like Murano handiwork. Not that I've been there, either. Maybe... Oh, some of that jewelry looks cute in the blue booth there, actually. I see a yellow gem one." Shape pauses and then smiles at Silver, before continuing with lower inflection, "...They might have jewelry for dudes, like me, too. I guess. Just not, like, the ones of shark teeth or something, please."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Don't worry too much about it, dearie. Though I do like when people owe me favors, it's convenient." She laughs softly, and then follows Shape's eyes to the blue booth. "Oh, I would never. Shark teeth does sound very much the opposite of what would suit you. And I think you should wear things that look good on you, rather than following arbitrary categorizations like that." There's an almost dismissive tone in the latter part, though not aimed at Shape personally. Silver walks over to the mentioned booth, observing items with an obvious preference for the ones set in silver, not gold.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape nods. Nice to have someone who isn't anal about gender roles, then. He does end up kneeling down close to the glass display of the small yellow gem necklace, and is pleased with the simple design of the chain and three-prong design enclosing the gem. "You make a good point. Would you say I'd look good in it? Certainly, you'd look great in, yeah, those silver ones. Obviously. Verdict is still out on this yellow one for me." He opens his wallet, looking for a third opinion. He might get one in the form of the blonde older lady attending the display, though.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver gently taps the display, taking very care to only apply her fingernail to avoid prints on the glass. "How much is this one, and would you agree that it's a good fit for my companion? I think it's quite decent, but I'd assume you more an expert." There's a price tag, surely, but with Shape somewhat in the way it's a good excuse to strike conversation. Her eyes wander back to a silver ring with a blossom ornament, bearing a rather fine pearl in its middle. It's not cheap. "And, I would like this one for myself. Assuming it fits, of course."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		The seller scoots forward on her office chair she rolled out here to the art festival, and her many gold bracelets sit on the glass. "Oh, sure, dear. The yellow topaz piece is going to be 46 dollars, it's very lively and your friend seems that way." She pulls it from behind the display, along with the silver ring. She sets both on a layer of cloth on the glass display. "This beautiful piece will cost you a pretty 210 dollars. 12-millimeter pearl and 925 silver. The necklace should be adjustable, and the ring we can check, although it's sized to most women such as yourself." Shape puts away his wallet sheepishly, unsure how willing he's going to be to give 46 dollar value back to his new friend any time so soon. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver slides the ring on carefully once she has the permission, pleased with the fit. She puts it back before taking out a rather more stylish leather wallet, compared to Shape's. 210, and 46, she adds. Hmm... Silver's not in the mood for dealing with this much loose change, so she offers up two hundreds and a fifty, taking care to not let Shape have a good look at the amount. With just a faint hint of emphasis, she chimes, "That should be sufficient. Keep the change."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Sure, thank you for your purchase, dear!" She says, convinced on the amount. She turns her attention to a nearby couple, and Shape takes a business card from the booth along with his new necklace before he walks off with Silver. He keeps both in his pockets for now, though. "Hey, thanks Silver, again. That's really nice of you to be willing to do that. You really didn't have to, you know, there's no fee to us just hanging out of course. With that in mind... I might only want to look at a few more booths real quick, probably, and then I think I'm good for now, yeah. I never buy too much at once anyhow. I like the ring on you, by the way! The pearl fits you as much as the silver, yeah."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"It really isn't a problem, darling." She muses. "If it were a problem I wouldn't have done it. And you seemed to like it." As they move through, she eyes the wares they pass idly, before interrupting to note some paintings on offer. They're quite exquisite, a larger one of a wintery landscape with snow-covered trees catching attention more than the others. 
		<p>
		She doesn't hesitate, despite the price probably being something that makes Shape somewhat unwell to picture spending himself. With a few short comments, she's bought it, offering in quite a bit extra to have it delivered to her hotel room. Not generally a service anyone would be getting, but she's insistent and the added pay is good.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Indeed, Shape's a bit pale and quiet throughout the purchase. He must have spent good money on a glass corner cabinet thing once, but that was at least two magnitudes less expensive... When he finally is walking from the booth with her, he puts his hand on her arm and says, "Cool, so, I feel pretty tired, actually. Maybe we could think about heading back to my place? There might be some things there. In general, though, I'd just like to sit maybe and chat, maybe over a bit of dinner." They walk over a manhole and caramel popcorn.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"If you're tired, then that is probably a good idea. I'll accept your offer of dinner, in return for the necklace. Don't feel pressured to do anything overly fancy though." She again lets him lead the way, noting all the roads and stores they pass for future reference.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		----------------------------------------
		<br>
		The walk is only about twenty minutes, and Shape opens the door for them and closes it behind them. "So, right, I take it you're not much for television. What sort of thing would you like to do, maybe? I have, like, cards. I forgot how to play solitaire and stuff though. Even though I have a lot of free time, I guess I haven't had it with a guest in a while, so yeah." He rubs his own neck and sits on the couch in the living room. By now one of the arms of it slump. "I wonder, Silver, have you always been kinda affluent? Or was it more of a new money thing rather than an old money thing? I thought about maybe starting a business. Not really sure how you'd approach that."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver takes seat not far from Shape on the couch. The suggestions for entertainment are mostly ignored, for now. "Quite a... cozy little place you have here, Shape dear. As for my financial situation, it's a rather long story. It's not a very recent development but it's all my own efforts. No inheritance or the likes. The gifts my existence has blessed me with are of other kinds, and I simply apply those well. I won't bore you with the details of it all though." She quickly deflects the topic once she's satisfied with her answer. "What manner of business is on your mind?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"I mean, I would hardly be bored, Silver. I think you know that." Shape shrugs. Gifts blessed with "of other kinds?" She's probably hiding some weird shit. Could be cult, could be royalty, maybe simply magic. "Yeah, I like my place too. I've had it for like 12 years now. I guess the business I was thinking of would be reselling stuff I get from vendors of some sort. Or maybe I can make a product. I know a lot of people do stuff like soap, but maybe I could make my own tea, I guess? I like tea; I have a pretty modest collection of tea bags even. I could see that being a rewarding practice to ship those." He takes off his shoes and lies across the couch, dangling his feet off the side to give Silver space. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver knows this, yes, but she's really not keen on delving into the details. Way too many cans of worms that should remain unopened. "That's... Fairly loose an idea, I can't really give advice if you yourself don't know what you're aiming for. Tea, you say? I didn't quite read you as a considerable tea-knower but I do like to be surprised. Do you have faith in being able to handle that?" She doesn't feel infringed in space by Shape taking up most of the sofa, giving a look down at him. "You seem awfully comfortable around strangers, or at least with me. Are you experienced with new people?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"I have faith that I might be able to learn. I guess motivation is hard to keep straight for me more so than just being... you know, capable," He admits. He looks up to her, and hums before saying, "Uh, yep. I have met plenty of people in my time, plenty pretty exotic as well. It's always a pleasure to meet new people. You've been one yourself. A very refined and classy woman. With mysterious gifts, apparently." If only his retention rate with new people was higher. Somehow, he's managed to make sure he has sex and awkward departures more often than not. He pushes the comment, murmuring, "I might have those too. They're also pretty irrelevant."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		The atmosphere seems to freeze up around Silver. The conversation took a turn she had not at all expected and was seemingly quite uncomfortable with. The idea that Shape was more than just a commoner and also caught onto her loose descriptions with such ease? Meant that in some way, shape or form, he could pose a threat to her doings. Or maybe he knew people, or otherwise beings, that might. 
		<p>
		She takes two deep breaths, stares down at him quite sharply despite putting on a friendly face, and whispers. "Oh, they might be very relevant. Please, tell me about them."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape comes to regret staring back at her. Her presence is immediately made alien from warm and elegant, and Shape is very compelled to delve on information he definitely didn't want to just mention, at least so lamely as it were. He's definitely been this loose before, but, really, it could wait-- "I'm a shapeshifter. As in, I can turn into different people. Kind of a party trick and lifestyle choice more than anything..." He says, and sucks his lips in after, for a moment. He sits up in his seat, and runs behind the coach to toward the kitchen, and he says aloud, "Okay, what the fuck, Silver? What was that shit? Are you a witch? Maybe you're one of those nymphs of the woods or something... I'd rather say things at my own pace, please? I really would."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver is almost as startled as Shape is; not only did she lay on her powers far too thick, but she didn't even consider that obviously he would have some form of experience. She puts her face in her hands and makes a rather uncharacteristic groaning sound. "I am.... I am very sorry about that." She doesn't care to address the information she extracted just yet. "It's all quite complicated. I did not take you to be something more than common, and I, well. I panicked a bit when you mentioned you were. I have little experience with... Other unnatural people, I suppose."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape pours himself water in the kitchen, glancing at his spear he last left beside the fridge. “Yeah, all right. Whatever lady. Sorry I'm a bit pissed BUT I think you'd understand if you do this often that this isn't... It's not kosher, yeah? It kind of is invasive and shit.” He sips his drink, spilling a bit on his collar. “Okay, well you know now I'm not 'common,' for sure. Don't call me unnatural. Anyway, would like you something to drink too or do we need to, like, start over maybe really.” It's not really phrased like a question, but the part of it that's a request is unclear.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"No, no, you're very right. That was entirely uncalled for. And... I was more referring to myself, not you, but apologies for that as well." It's clear that Silver is just as much unnerved by the entire situation, fidgeting to focus her stress away and speaking slowly as her usually refined tone and words don't fall to her nearly as easily now. "Let me make you an offer. You're free to ask any questions, though I may turn some of them down. I won't influence you again, so we can have a proper conversation tonight. But I'll have to politely ask you keep everything about my... different nature to yourself. This place is cozy." She sighs. "And it'd be a shame to have to vanish again so soon. I really, really don't want to cause any issues." She looks at him, but quickly turns away again as there are still lingering magic in the air between them as the eyes meet. The difference between her earlier confident and elegant stature, and now, seems to deepen with each moment.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“I'll just get you some water. I don't really feel like offering wine... It's okay, I guess. Just okay.” Shape grabs his spear beside the fridge, after some deliberation, and leaves it hidden from Silver's view by leaning it behind the wall just beside the counter you'd clip the corner of entering the kitchen. He walks over to hand Silver her drink, and then he walks back to beside the counter seemingly just to grab his, but he doesn't join her back in the living room. He continues, “I wouldn't even have anyone to talk about your powers to.” Except, what, Vera. “Sure, I guess I'll ask some questions. I also enjoy your company, with a bit of caution. So uh... Okay, here's something, did you even want to be my friend? Was all that earlier about the art stalls just buying time for this? I really liked the necklace, you know.” He rubs his own shoulder.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver takes it off his hands most carefully, taking care not to touch him in any way in the process. People have tended to fear that when knowing, even though it has no bearings on her power. "From my understanding of your lil' Miss Blogger friend, I would very much not have someone who likes to write and share information so eagerly know. So that is not awfully reassuring." She takes a few slow sips of the water and then rotates the glass idly in her hands. "My efforts were genuine, I promise. You'd be correct, when I'm out and about there's surely also on my mind the chance I find people who would be a considerable benefit to have influence over. I bet anyone in my position would. But I do also actually seek company. It gets so awfully lonely whenever I need to find a new place to reside in. Genuine company is so much harder to achieve than most things in life. Please... I did really mean well with all these things. I took a liking to you from the very start." 
		<p>
		She sighs, deeply. It's such a strain, being so open about herself. She's not feeling well at all, and she looks the part. But she wants to make things good again, somehow.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape sighs, following hers. He drinks as well, and says, “I think you're a bit reserved of a person. I think I was maybe more like that when I was younger. I'm not some 20 year old, after all. I've changed a lot. Just know I guess that even though we might have great powers of manipulation that maybe, yeah, it's not nice to do that, I guess. Hmm.” He taps his bare feet on the lining between living room rug and kitchen tile. “Yeah, I had so much time and I still can't hold a friend too long, my oldest ones have already left for greater things... I tell you what I'd do if I had that power, I'd use it to make friends. And steal money from rich people. Which I guess is what shapeshifting is also like, in theory.” He leaves his glass at the counter, and he walks closer to Silver, avoiding her gaze. “Oh, Vera? She's actually a bit of a softy, I swear, and I don't really have interest in telling her about this. She wouldn't shut up about this, or anything that happens. Even I find that annoying. Although she seemed distracted today, anyway, so.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I should have guessed, I suppose. Shapeshifting seems very practical to retain an impression of youth. I've instead tried my best to simply grow my manners along with my age, maybe." She falls silent a bit. Reflecting on her own relative youth. Man, how times have changed. "I've tried using my powers to make friends, in some ways. It feels... Hollow, in the end. Whether they falsely believe I'm a lifelong friend already, or they are fascinated by my power and are attached to that more than me. Keeping my powers and the people I have affected separate from my actual social relations has become a given over time." She doesn't comment on the money part, but there's a most subtle smile when Shape mentions Vera.
		<p>
		"Greater things? I'd be curious but I won't pry. Talking about people of the past rarely ever makes me happy." She rubs the back of her neck awkwardly. "And, well. There's a lot of them for me."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		This about Silver's failed attempts to have powers involved in her social life tickles Shape. Of course it wouldn't work, it couldn't. In the end, it's a cheap party trick, same as Shape's, surely, or hard manipulation. He felt strange to have even suggested the idea now. He's been there...
		<p>
		He sits on the couch, away from Silver, with his head back and his eyes closed. He says, “Greater things in this case I just mean like... Going to some island with an ocarina, or returning to a cave to maintain a forest, or even just trying to fuck some chick named Rose. Hell, Vera's barely around herself. Workaholic, kind of not interested... It sounds like people in your past were manipulated, of course, yeah. But hey, maybe not this time?”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Heh. Congratulations to Rose, I suppose." Silver was still seated facing the direction Shape had been sitting earlier, but turns away from them as he's seated there again and instead observes the rest of the room idly. "I've had a few or other genuine ones. Nothing impressive. I suppose I'm not the best at just being a person around people." She sighs. "People are complicated. It's so easy to simplify them if needed, but that's not always right for me, even in the selfish assessment of things." 
		<p>
		"I hope I'm not making myself seem entirely unpleasant or such with this. It's not often I start reflecting too deeply? I..." She stops for some time. "I'm very uncomfortable right now. But that's all my fault. Mostly because I choose to not take the easy way out of using my powers to solver everything... Because I like you just a bit too much, it seems."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“I didn't say Rose actually wanted to have sex with him.” He laughs, and folds his hands together. “Hmm, I've had some experiences with people's minds being changed, but yeah, again it just always seemed more like a sexy thing than a strategic one. What are you trying to get out of people anyway? Money kinda? Importance? I have to admit that I'm not the most comfortable I've ever felt, but I at least feel I'm not underhanded, and I really did like our time together too. So, yeah, let's just let this be a bit awkward, Silver... Are you hungry? Perhaps you'd like food before you go.” Trying to court Silver to the bed, unlike most people Shape met, seemed poor. Even if she was a nice day to be with. “Oh, uh, and my phone number in any case.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"It's... a complicated question. But as you might suppose, my wealth isn't off the back of purely human efforts. I haven't destroyed anyone's livelihood to achieve it, of course. It's easy to strike lopsided deals with people when they think it's not the case, and then make the traces disappear later. Businesspeople are all part of a large game, and I simply bend the rules. Such are the risks of the system." She seems pleased with this justification, and ends her tangent there. "Importance is sketchy, if earned dishonestly. And you may notice that I try to keep my importance on the down low. The more people perceive me, the... The harder it is to stay in control." 
		<p>
		"Thank you for... For your trust and patience, though. I'd have understood if you kicked me out or such earlier, though it'd surely have complicated matters for me. I think exchanging phone numbers is good, yeah. Feel free to give me a call if there is anything at all." She produces a small notepad and a silver pen out of one of her inner pockets, and quickly scribbles her number on it, tearing off the page and placing it down on the sofa in Shape's direction. "It might be a better option than talking to others about me, I suppose... Oh, I probably am supposed to eat something. I do not quite feel like it, but needs are needs."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape glowers, somewhat, partway through the monologue. He... folds his legs together and sighs, and then opens his eyes once more to search for the note and then input it into his phone in his pants pocket. He leaves a text, which is an emote of a wave. He says, “I try to be patient, yeah. Let's keep in touch. Although, regarding dinner, I kind of don't have anything good to eat, I guess... And I'm pretty tired. Hmm. If you don't feel like eating too I guess you don't always have to.” So her wealth was hard earned, probably an entire lifetime of manipulation. This was much worse than just a tendency to want more friends or show off, or even covering for herself, this was like an entire operation. It was...  morbid. Dirty money, and who knows if it was all wrapped up with lies still, maybe she destroyed lives, maybe she continues to want to manipulate, well, him... If Vera knew about this, she'd snuff this woman's entire operation, but Shape wasn't going to bother. Really convenient that Vera didn't press further. Really. “Reputation is everything, sure... I have no intentions to bother your business, I want to remind you. All we're going to be is two people who know each other and hang out sometimes, yeah...”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"And I won't bother you with it, don't worry." She sips again at her still more than half full glass. He seems upset. More than ideal. And she doesn't understand. She takes out the phone to see the message, and makes a half-hearted giggle at the wave emoji before saving the number. "I... Yeah, I do hope we can manage that, maybe. It would be nice. You are nice."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“Yeah. So. I'll have some more time to think about all this, but, yeah, I hope we could manage that. I think that would be. Lovely. After all... ” Shape stands up, and walks behind Silver, towering over her. “You're young, beautiful, and have a lot of money, at the least. It's okay if you don't want the rest of your water before you have to go for now.” 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver sets aside the glass almost as if on command. Shape is right; she should leave. "Young, you say? Sometimes I feel like time is the one thing that escapes me the most. It can't be convinced the way I would so many other things... At least, I haven't found a way to do so yet." She doesn't have anything to pack up, so she simply stands up and turns to Shape. Averting her eyes, instead focusing on a rather arbitrary spot on the back of the sofa. "As I said, I'll be doing my best to move into a residence to the west. You have my phone number, if there is anything." She sighs, considers a handshake but again decides that skin contact is maybe not something she should be inviting right now. It could scare him. "I don't feel like I'm in a position to ask for much but again, I prefer these details about me don't get too much traction. Take care, and do rest well."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“I'd say young, yeah. And, yeah, it's difficult to emulate real life experience going back far unless you have a most potent form of magic. So that makes sense.” He leans against the sofa behind where Silver was sitting prior. And he nods when she looks away from his eyes. “I'll call you. Thank you again for the yellow necklace. I'll wear it next time. Maybe I'll go to your place? Surely it's only the most opulent setting?” He almost snickers. He takes the glass from her hands gently. “I won't spread this info, no. I thought about it, and no. We'll just keep it between us. Goodnight as well.” He walks with Silver to the door, holding her arm. He sips from her glass of water. And he closes the door after she's inspired to walk away a few feet.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		As soon as she's out of the view from him, she takes to leaning against a streetlight for a bit. Sigh. That was much more of a situation than she'd anticipated, and she still needs to arrange her new living space. Hopefully sooner now that she's already expecting a visitor. An interior designer would be in order; she's not in the mood to arrange things herself any more. At least to start. 
		<p>
		She begins the slow trod back to her hotel, her path following the exact one the two took earlier today. It's much more empty, more lonely now that it's late and she's by herself, and she has lost that light and secure feeling of being new and unknown to a place already.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		----------------------------------------
		<br>
		It only took a quick private plane reservation and submerged vehicle, but a distant Vera Hanley has been home for a few hours now, tending to a proper Italian dish and her massive log of notes. When she reviews her notes concerning today's events, she stops chewing her food and spits some of it back on the dish. “Why did I abandon the interview? Hello?” She wasn't on an official assignment, but any interview, on or off the clock, would end when she said it'd end-- or something severe happened. And Vera terminated it because someone, this Silver, asked her to?
		<p>
		About thirty minutes later, Silver receives a phone number with international digits.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver's has just barely made herself comfortable back at home when she has to turn the TV on mute. She isn't even sure what she's looking at yet, but odds are it really doesn't matter. What she does know is that generally, taking a call is better than missing them. Just in case something in her vast web of influences has gone awry and needs to be attended to. 
		<p>
		"Hello, you are talking to Silver. How may I help you?" It's a trained voice, formal and businesslike. A good fallback, considering she doesn't want her current mood to bleed into the conversation.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Last time we talked you didn't seem eager to answer me. So this time I have a single question for you: Silver, how did you make me leave the café?” She has a pristine speaking voice, Vera, and she so often uses it for the most unpleasant of exchanges. She continues, glossing over her plan outline, “I am certain it was your fault. I would never, for any reason, cut an interview because someone smiled and asked. Let's gut that misconception.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Oh, god. Not this, not now. Not her. Silver could never have realized that Vera's this level of workaholic and stubborn that she'd piece together matters just from being dismissed once. She'd have poor hopes of convincing her way out of a one on one meeting, let alone over the phone. 
		<p>
		"I do not know what you're talking about, Miss Blogger. You seemed a bit unwell, I think I recall, are you sure you really just weren't up for it? The atmosphere in the café was pretty heavy." She dares not infuse any degree of influence in her words. Vera would notice something being off with Silver's tone well before it had any real effect, and it's obvious she's very set in her ways.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Silver, I don't need anyone to decipher my own intentions. I'm well aware of what I desire.” She pauses while she notes an abbreviated version of this dismissive claim. Town AI would have a backup of this entire exchange anyway. “It's precedent that Shape meets magical people. I won't go in further detail, however this leads me to believe, combined with the case I've presented so far, that you're magical or bear technology that is indistinguishable from magic.” That's a familiar quote. “Evidently, I'm going to work out the details. With or without your assistance. At least apologize to me, manipulator.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Vera can practically hear the eye-rolling in Silver's voice as she puts on her snarkiest-but-still-dignified tone. 
		<p>
		"Fine. I'm so sorry for being a big bad evil witch sorceress who's here to cause mayhem and destruction by convincing poor innocent interrogators that they have unusual mood swings." 
		<p>
		Something about Vera's tone and mannerisms is quite upsetting though, she's very professional and proper - there's little chance she's just a casual hobby blogger like it seemed at first. And she's aware of Shape's magic, and about its, even to Silver, somewhat more frequent abundance. She's a threat, much more so than Shape. "Listen, I do not know what you want, but what I want is to get some well-earned rest. It's been a very long day. So I'd appreciate if you would... Actually? Where did you get my number, anyhow? I can't recall giving it to you."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She adjusts the position of the tablet, causing noise to register in the microphone, and then she says, “I believe that's sarcasm, although I'd believe it... Sorry that you're exhausted, however I wanted a real apology. And, beyond this call, the truth.” She continues, “I convinced Shape using 'cool magic powers' to share your phone number. I have burner numbers as well, and therefore I will be able to call often.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver is not going to back down from this easily. Not only is she hard in her ways, she also has a lot riding on this and would rather wait out a real conversation if she is to ever confide anything at all. "I generally consider apologies to be relevant when there are actual things to apologize for. They're not like candy, treats that you give to fussy kids just because it'll help their odd moods. Makes sense that Shape would confide in you, a lovely friend you have there. Quite enjoyable. You could learn a thing or two from him, about being a pleasant person who is fun to talk to." Silver takes a note to not block the number, like she intended to.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“The only child here is you,” she mumbles. “A child would demand someone to leave them to their candy. A child would cry and make demands that way, like you do, and try to keep foul secrets. You think you're better than me. No matter. Have you been properly acquainted to Shape? I know everything you could desire to know. He's not all he's hyped to be.” She takes more of her now cold food in, and mutes the microphone for this. She's finding something out of this other than information, at least, before she should hang up unsatisfied. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver sighs audibly. "I don't know what your deal is, girlie, but you're surprisingly petulant for a blogger. I thought those generally strived to be popular in some sense. I'll do my own research on Shape in due time, so please keep this a spoiler free zone. So far, my choices of interaction seem to be him and you, and you seem less appealing let alone a choice, considering you've already threatened to roleplay as a marketing caller with your various phones. I'll give you one more snide comment, and I'll then push the red button on my phone that makes me not have to listen to you anymore. Unless you want to offer some actually useful insight instead."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Well, the organic yerba mate I posted about in my lifestyle blog must keep me focused.” She grins to herself. Not to be seen. She doesn't dwell on the insults other than that about popularity, where she says, “Anyone can be popular if they manipulate the intentions of the people around them. I just ask questions. I have nothing useful to tell you anymore, since you have nothing useful to tell me in exchange, however you should consider cultivating a heart, something full of vesicles people come with. I can lack one too.” Vera decides to end the call, and she removes her plate from her bed with a headache.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver drops the phone onto the sofa, where it lands face down with a soft 'pufh' sound. She unmutes the television to the middle of some straight person rom-com movie that somehow is still more intriguing that what had just transpired. She'll soon have a late night meal as she is, in fact, in need of actual nutrients. And then try to sleep through processing all of what has happened today. What a hassle.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		----------------------------------------
		<br>
		A few days later, Vera Hanley initiates another step of her plan she outlined. She brought in her sash her tablet, pocket Taser, and a tool more commonly given to the Town enforcers. She has protective measures and strategies for Silver's unknown magic. And she knocks on the door of the house that Silver has to her name corresponding to the geolocation of the phone. Silver was, unfortunately, not very traceable beyond this. Her name is a metal.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Visitors, so soon? Maybe a neighbor who insists on saying hi. Or maybe Shape. The very thought that it could be Vera doesn't cross Silver's mind until the door is already open. Very must have been looking directly at Silver to catch the generic, inviting smile melt off her face instantly. 
		<p>
		"You."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Hey again. I may have brought a housewarming gift, but I had no knowledge if the tradition was in your cultural background.” Vera tries to enter the house, stepping beside Silver. “Let's just keep it professional. I can't convince you to say anything you don't want to say, after all.” Vera is speaking louder than last time.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver does not object to Vera passing in any way, but interjects. "Awfully bold of you to step into my territory. I'd be concerned about going headfirst into the house of a supposed witch... Apologies. Professional sounds good. Make yourself comfortable, the living room is to the left." She closes the door behind them both. If Vera wants to undress and find a place to put her shoes, that's her own problem. Silver takes the door to the left ahead of her, rendering the comment before mostly moot.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera watches Silver's expression, and her lips, as much as she can. Silver's voice is barely audible through these earplugs, after all. She takes her shoes off simply at the front door, and then follows Silver closely into the living room and says, “There's a first time for everything. If anything, I'm excited to be somewhere new with people I don't know much about.” Vera sits close to wherever Silver sits or stands, and she retrieves her note device from her sash. “Anything you'd prefer me to write into the record, before I might ask questions? Besides that question, paradoxically.” 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver takes a comfortable relined position on her sofa, house shoes left on the floor, motioning to a chair somewhat adjacent. The result ends up looking, possibly intentionally, like a stereotypical visit to the psychologist. She stares up into the ceiling, partially to mask her expressions a bit and to avoid making eye contact. Surely, this will make matters more complicated for Vera. 
		<p>
		"Oh, I still do not know exactly what you're aiming to achieve so I don't actually know where to start. No, Silver is not my real birth name and I have a last name too. But I've made it such a pervasive method of referring to me that those will lead you to less success than just trying to find information about Silver."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Yeah. Withheld, in the pursuit of knowledge, we take stabs in the dark. It is not always clear what we're aiming to pin with precision.” She types some notes, and keeps her eyes steady on Silver's lips. She sits up a bit taller to see them when Silver faces up like this. “Perhaps we should start with the information about yourself that you're comfortable sharing. For example, your chosen alias is Silver; however, what is your age, what is your college reading level?”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I generally try to be a pleasant conversationalist partner for these reasons. People simply keep talking when you give them a good arena to do so. And relevant things will come up eventually, especially if you ask the right things." 
		<p>
		Silver has to make sure she doesn't allude to her... Techniques too much. 
		<p>
		"I like to joke that one shouldn't ask a lady her name, I think you have more potentially important reasons to note it down. So... 29 years. A good number. As for reading level, I don't know your weird numbering and descriptive systems so I'll simply say that it's more than sufficient for any and all purposes. I know words."
		<p>
		"When you say 'write into the record', what record may this be anyhow?"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		An interesting thing to highlight how people can bleed information, although Vera suspects it could be because Silver is trying to remind herself. Vera tugs her dark hair aside, and she says, “29 years it is. And it's not common enough that I interview such literate candidates. An unusual correlation exists between people living in scrapyards and resources they shouldn't have access to, for instance.” In some ways, this pace was boring. But, given it's not an assignment, she lets herself ease her way through. “It's confidential; however I can assure you that it is nothing to trouble yourself with. I'll inform you when there's an issue, and even with your powers I can't admit you're dangerous.” 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"You remember what I said about relevant things coming up naturally? Now you have me curious about what manner of interview research you have due with people possessing illegal materials. I have my suspicions about you too, you see. Ones actually founded in reasonable observations and conclusions..." She sighs. Don't become snarky again already. No need to make a whole scene out of this. "I'm very curious about this whole powers thing, truly. Yes, I did come across the detail that Shape has some... Unnatural leanings, but is this really such a commonplace thing in your life that you accuse random people of witchcraft?"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“In an alternate universe, I'm sure you're the one working my job. In this one, I prefer to be more matter of fact in my role. You're right to believe that subtle encouragement can reveal more information than originally intended. Maybe you're wrong to assume that I'm all secrets.” She sighs, in return. She closes her eyes, and then opens then. If she was going to be anyone to talk about her job in detail with, it should be the career center in Town. She says, anyway, “Yeah. I am certain-- fully assured-- if I did something you weren't in agreement with, you'd wave me away again... Shape does have magical friends, and I've met a few. You're only another. Magic is imprecise, and the rules change, I find.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver sits up properly, facing Vera. This is incredibly fluffy and devoid of content, all in all. She tries to make eye contact. Not for magical purposes, but very deliberately.
		<p>
		"I don't see why I'm the one who deserves interrogation when you're acting like some sort of secret agent with magical friends who will pursue business ladies in their own home to go on the most peculiar philosophical tangents. I still don't know what your plan is and I'm realizing more and more that maybe I am the one being played here. What sort of potentially malicious intents are you up to?"
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera avoids Silver's eyes. It's a bit, well, childlike. “Please, Silver, I'm not a 'secret agent.' There's no James Bond. And I don't see why you think I'm malicious. I genuinely want to know about you in the pursuit of knowledge. And-- assuming you're not defending a painstaking list of evil intentions, past to future, how'd you like me to prove my purpose is understanding what there is to understand about you?” She stows her notetaking device in her sash, and she keeps her hand buried in her sash. Finding the grip on the Taser, and finding the electromagnetic restrainers.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I'm still quite attached to the point that you managed and decided to pursue me in my own newly obtained housing over the sole point that I... 'Made you leave'?" 
		<p>
		Vera seems intimidated. Good. Silver moves closer, instead choosing to sit on the edge of the coffee table. It gives her a bit more height over Vera and closes the gap some. 
		<p>
		"I want to understand, want to take you seriously, but it all makes so little sense to me. It becomes more and more natural to me to suppose you have deeper motives. How would you prove this, anyhow? You're all 'confidentiality' and mystery. We both seem to be unable to get anything useful out of this for each our reasons, and you're acting like the part that has anything to gain from it. Who wants to gain something from this. I'm just trying to have a cozy day for myself." 
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She says, and she grits her teeth initially, “If you came across something you didn't understand, why would you walk away from it? Are you content living in the shadow of the truth?” And then Vera is quiet for a while, and her fingers play lightly on the trigger of the Taser, and she stands up slowly. “Let's assume you're innocent. If I'm convinced it's impossible I left on my own accord, and you're convinced you're a business woman with an immaculate sophistication, then what conclusion could we possibly draw? Are you going to paint a third party? Are you going to continue to accuse me of being wrong about my conviction, and press and press to convince me I am, in fact, evil?” Even standing up, Vera is shorter than Silver. It's not particularly close. She walks closer to the table with Silver. “I asked you how I'd prove this. I do not know how I would. However, I agree. This is quickly pointless-- talking to you. Maybe that's what you wanted to hear?”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver stands up too, arms crossed across her chest. There's a threatening closeness between the two now. "Maybe, just maybe, I have better things to do in my life. I am a busy woman. Do you think I achieved the ability to causally take residence in a house like this by chasing fairytales? No, I focus on the things I know are fruitful. I'm getting very tired of this, and I'm getting quite tempted to having you removed from my house, honestly." 
		<p>
		Silver pulls her phone out of her pocket, starts pressing some things on the screen.

		"I think you'll find there's nothing really magical in making a Disturbance Call to the authorities."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“I'm a busy woman as well. And chasing fairytales is all I do. Or it comprises at least part of my days.” Vera swiftly removes the magnetic instruments from her sash, and she slaps their sticky straps on the back of Silver's hands. Silver's phone screen flickers strange colors, and Silver's hands are immediately squeezed together in an incredibly uncomfortable and useless lock, strap to strap of the futuristic handcuffs. The phone drops. This brief time, Vera backs up and shows her Taser, which is a small and buzzing collection of metal pinpricks. “The interview isn't over until I say it's over. Are you going to use your magic now? Come on now, you're useless without it.” She bites her lip, and glances around them, before checking Silver's lips again.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver swears loudly. Surprising amount of flavor for a dignified woman of her kind. He eyes briefly lock with Vera and there's the subtlest tingle of magical intent to her gaze... But no. It's probably not enough for Vera to be certain, in the moment. The phone is a good way for Silver to distract herself, as she stumbles back into the sofa for fair of falling over and not being able to catch herself. 
		<p>
		"You're fucking deranged. You're really lucky I have a fresh backup of most of my data, I could ruin you legally over damage to data and still come out worse than you. This is literally what I was getting at; you're a madwoman with mysterious, questionable affiliations and have the fucking audacity to say I'm the one who's posing an issue here." She lowers her voice some, and rests her cuffed hands inconveniently in front of her face. "Unhand me right now, or I'll do everything in my powers to make your next while a living hell." She knows Vera likely won't be able to understand her, maybe. She wants to test how well those peculiar earplugs work, seeing what fancy technology Vera seems to possess.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera faces Silver, and she raises her eyebrow with a dash of whim. At long last, control. “You can sue me if you delight. You can dub me a madwoman, that's alright too. How about we simply wait here for hours? A working class, unthreatening, embarrassing woman like yourself is powerless in this scenario, after all. Since, after all, you claim to be innocent of magic. It doesn't matter if I'm alien or a wizard, what matters is that I have you here as long as I intend-- in an interview or staring contest. Because you're just a white-haired sandbag.” Vera simply ignores what she is unable to hear, assured it's along the same lines anyway. She breathes in deeply. “So anyway. Let's keep it professional.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver decides that the handcuffs are more interesting that Vera's incessant monologue. She continues speaking in the same tone while her face is occupied by looking at the curious device on her hands. It's some sort of fluffy tirade about her business contacts, about professionalism, about claiming she has so much patience and very few places to be anytime soon. In truth, her thoughts are an endless string of trying to think of how to most effectively get her one shot back at Vera. She's cuffed, and Miss Blogger has a Taser and some amount of ear protections. If she commits and misses, the consequences would be most dire indeed considering Vera's still unknown capabilities and connections.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		She nods and tries watching Silver's lips and interpreting them and listening... Although, there's nothing to listen to, and Vera skipped the lip-reading elective in training, she just kind of skimmed through some of the common practices yesterday to compensate. She blinks a lot more, and she touches her own arm with her free hand. “Thank you... This monologue has some good information. I'll have to write this all down soon... Do you mind if you speak with a bit more volume, I'm hard of hearing and you want to have me leave sooner than later.” She steps closer to the couch and cups one ear.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		A crucial mistake on Vera's part. Silver scans the earpiece that's clearly presented to her. It's... Truly nothing special, she's certain of that now. She moves her hands down from her face, and mouths something without actually making noise, each syllable defined for emphasis. No magic, but a very clear statement nonetheless. 
		<p>
		"I can tell your bluff. Look at me, you insolent little brat." 
		<p>
		She's staring intently, watching every little movement on Vera's part. 
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“Very well. I'm not hard of hearing. And I've been looking.” Vera says these statements, one after another, enjoying the clear enunciation portrayed on Silver's lips. “Tell me, Silver, how you inherited your vast fortune. Engage with me in an all-telling story about your motivators, your obstructions, your strategy.” Vera tries to keep her eyes steady. Silver's hard gaze is perturbing the peripheral vision, however.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I make the rules now." One last gentle mouthed note, and it's already too late. 
		<p>
		Silver makes one abrupt motion, locking into Vera's eyes before she has a chance to flinch. The magical impact is like a psychic punch to the face as Silver yells, with every ounce of her power channeled. "You will obey me, Vera. Put your weapon down, remove your earpieces, and free my hands. I am your superior and you only act as instructed, now."
		<p>
		She pants, having exerted a good part of her voice and magic in one single action.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera cries out in return, and her eyes, for a flash of light, feel stabbed straight through with dark lasers and bright wires. She lets go of her Taser, in a combination of the effect and of the startle, and she rubs her eyes and slides back her legs against the table. However... Vera collects herself. And in very intended fashion, Vera takes her ear pieces off of her, throws them onto Silver's lap, and unlatches the strange magnetic cuffs with a bit of finesse that'd be nigh accessible to the wearer. She's gasping for stability, looking like she might cry. “I finally know the fucking truth. You're a witch. You're a rotten witch, and can make me do that.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"It could have been so very simple. You leave me the fuck alone and we don't have any issues. But you had to play with fire no matter how hard I tried to protect you from it. You still don't know what I am capable of. Unfortunately, you seem to actually matter in some way, have connections, so I can't just entirely get rid of you that easily." This is a deliberately vague threat. "Sit down, and tell me who you work for, why you are so intent on meddling with people that may pose a risk. I need to know who'd come knocking at my door if you didn't return to them." 
		<p>
		She's both triumphant and venomously angry at the same time, rubbing her hands to soothe the discomfort of the device. "Whatever happens today and after is all your fault."
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		“I always fly close to the sun. And I flew too close.” Her voice is hoarse, and she wipes a tear off of her. “Look, I'm all about the truth. I wasn't going to leave you alone...” With the command, Vera's authority over her free will is loosened. A horrible feeling. She sits down with Silver, and she says unenthusiastically but also weakly yet, “I work for a city called Town, and its AI. I'm a field researcher, and therefore it's less about stopping you and more akin to reporting.” Vera pushes on Silver. Vera then starts digging into her own dark scalp of hair, creating an awful tangle. “This gains you nothing.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"My entire existence, dear, is about doing my own little things that cause me to stay wealthy at expense of whatever uselessly rich contacts I can sway in my direction. I don't cause problems with my powers—I solve them. And I'm going to solve you out of my way as well, as I already tried to. But you're stubborn and incessant and I'm going to have to dig very deep into your mind to fix that. I like this place and I'm not going to move an eighth time in six years just because of you. Because unlike you, I take the low effort routes and simply let go of my ties when it avoids trouble." 
		<p>
		"I don't understand you. I don't understand people like you. Only looking to achieve issues where there are none. You want a truth? I'll make my own truth, and when you find yourself at home, you will believe every word of what I will tell you, forgetting what actually transpired today. And what happened last time we met. You'll find a way to deal with any records of our phone call too; I believe you could manage that. Does all of that scare you? Good. Get it out while you still can, you'll be back to your uselessly oblivious self soon." She sighs, but in a warm kind of way. It's almost therapeutic, asserting her complete dominance after the stress Vera had caused. 
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera slumps into the couch, and her brief excitement at hearing how she probably indeed preserves her wealth is entirely shattered by this concept of... Making Vera believe a lie. Believing something verifiably false, with 100% conviction, despite being a member of the days that the truth would have been so abundantly clear. The only ties to the truth being the scattered notes she managed before Silver got the upper hand, and maybe what Town AI would know separate those calls, a shoddy story as that would be. She pulls and straightens her hair, then, dropping some strands on the couch.
		<p>
		She says, “Very well. I have no reason to believe anything... I wanted the truth because it's my passion. I love the truth. That's fundamentally why I'm a field researcher. So I'm scared Silver. I'll admit myself. I don't know who you are, I don't know if you've convinced me into a lie already-- I'm going to just-- be upset.” She stops with her hair, and she stares into Silver's eyes. No reason not to now. With nothing to leverage, Vera is only a young adult woman, a human. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver starts to feel sorry for the girl, but it's fine. It'll pass, all of this, and she will finally have some peace to do her things again. Shape is... honestly a rather complicating factor in this all, but it'll be fine. It always works out in the end for Silver, she tells herself. 
		<p>
		"In some way, I admire you. In your position, I'd have bitched out so long ago, facing something I believe to have overpowered me and despite this let me be. You said in some universe I'd maybe have your job instead... That's not true. You're capable of things I would never be. Like making me feel threatened in my own home despite clearly being vastly superior to you."
		<p>
		"So I'll be kind, and give you the comforting version, not the one that'll leave you feeling uncertain and worried and distressed about the inexplicable mismatches in your brain forever. It is time for you to believe a new truth about who I am, your experiences with me." 
		<p>
		Silver strings a story, about how Vera had been called in to some fruitless research the first time she'd left the cafe abruptly. About how the call had simply been a misplaced one, intended for someone else. Startlingly similar voice to Silver, so the confusion is understandable. About how the meeting today cleared up some critical misunderstandings, how they had some friendly tea and chatter together. How Vera had left feeling a bit dizzy and unwell, coming down with some sort of cold that will leave her lying in bed for a day due to an uncomfortable brain fog that makes sure to obscure all the true memories. About how Silver is, most undoubtedly, just a simple human.
		</div><div class="wrap Vera_w"><p>
		Vera has a hard time paying attention, but she at least takes the compliment and nods. She says, “Comforting it is,” and the false truth is smoothly pressed into the wrinkles of her brain that are so often responsible for memory and assessments. She almost smiles, although not quite, when that false story is entirely told, including events that haven't even happened yet. And so Vera goes through the motions of the film, and seeing as there's no tea around either of them, Vera says, “Once more, I apologize. The circumstances were unusual, indeed. This meeting and conversation has been... Somewhat delightful, I appreciated the earl grey with cream.” She blinks, and she tries to fix her hair that seems to be unkempt for some reason she doesn't dwell on. “If you meet something or someone that my interrogation or investigative skills could apply to, for no charge I'll follow through on it, Silver. I'm doing this for passion, and for the blog, not for service. For now, however, I must go. All the same as you, I'm a busy woman.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"It's been lovely, miss Blogger. Do take care, and I'll let you know if there's something you may help with in that regard." Earl grey with cream, hm. She takes a note of that, for no real purpose. She has brushed away the earpieces and Vera does not recollect having brought any - it'd be awkward to return them. "We have so much to attend to, as busy ladies, but it's always nice to get to sit down for some time. Best of luck out there." She gets up, and indicates towards the door before leading Vera out.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		----------------------------------------
		<br>
		Shape brushes her hair, checking the result with the scummy bathroom mirror. And then she runs by her adjacent bedroom once more and plucks the yellow gem necklace from the desk that Silver bought her. This will do for their encounter nicely.
		<p>
		She hears the front door as she's heading down, and she opens it to Silver. Compared to their first encounter, Shape is significantly more touched up. She's wearing something of a knee-length skirt and dress, beige and white and modestly revealing her shoulders, breasts, and arms.
		<p>
		She says, “Hey, Silver. I thought for our hangout I'd try on a different look this time. I was thinking about even wearing lipstick, I hadn't done that in a while, but I wanted to maybe share a wine with you and not stain the glass.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		There is a very brief look of confusion on Silver's face, but it fades and she giggles instead. "Ah yes. Shape. The Shape-Shifter. I don't think I ever specified but don't worry, I do appreciate guys and girls alike. So I'll gladly take you as you prefer. May I come in?" 
		<p>
		In comparison, Silver has mostly chosen a similar attire to always, but it's not like her casual attire lacks the fanciness to be excused as proper eveningwear as well. She does have a bit more striking heels than before, which adds to her height advantage over Shape.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“Of course! Come on in, and thank you, yeah. I did figure maybe you were looking to rest your eyes on a pretty lady today~,” She says. She immediately heads to the kitchen, where a pitcher of water and wine bottle and glasses already were. And she asks if Silver wants any of that. She continues, “It's a red wine. Are you a fan of those?”
		<p>
		She returns to the living room with some glasses for them, and she smiles with pleasant teeth. Her legs fold across one another, and she waves the television remote. “You look good too, Silver. See, yeah, part of the reason I'm dressed up too is I realized you're in, say, the country club tier of people? Given your wealth and valuable time. So I thought it'd be fun to play into that. I don't have television, but I could setup a movie or game if you like.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I do fancy myself a smaller amount of wine on occasion, thank you." Her gaze does fall up and down the length of the new Shape as she walks away into the kitchen. Good features, certainly. Shapeshifters have it nice in that regard, Silver thinks to herself. She moves to take a seat but eyes the living room over with some hesitance. She's still vaguely conscious about getting too close to Shape, but she settles at the end of the sofa. "I have been on occasion to some country clubs, yes. Good arrangements can be made there. I never quite caught the knack for golf but it honestly had its upsides. Wealthy men do get a bit thoughtless around women they think they can underestimate safely... I don't mean to go too much into that tangent though. I'm curious, what manner of games do you play?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		She sips a bit of the water she poured herself. The wine glasses for both of them and Silver's water are still on the coffee table. Lady Shape says, “Yeah... Golf seems kind of dreadful. Everything I see on television about it seems designed to put people to sleep, I don't know. I guess there's got to be good money in it for those good at it, sure. Or at least good at manipulation.” She rolls her eyes. “Anyway, yeah, I play... a few video games, sometimes. Like a fighting game. But when people are over I do own a few board games I play with them, or even just like social games that don't necessarily have a board. For the physical board games though, I have like a trivia board game. If you like answering trivia-- oh, maybe you're more into strategy though-- or I even have a cooperative one.” She's managed to be kneeling inside an opened closet in this room, reading off the games.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Video games really are not my forte, unfortunately. They go so fast and I am someone who enjoys a leisurely pace." She takes a small nip at her glass; quite certainly adequate, she's been offered some questionable swills in her past before so it's always nice to be pleased. 
		<p>
		"You have my attention at cooperative games. I find that having a winner and loser gets a bit repetitive on occasions so a teamwork game sounds quite curious." She lifts her glass and eyes over the gentle silver sparkle of her own lipstick on its rim.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“Yeah... I'm not going to lie, I'm not the quickest on my feet about that either. It's very casual stuff. I agree about playing the cooperative board game, then, yeah.” Shape hums, lifts the box from the stack, and walks over to the coffee table. She makes room for the board. It's the street map of a damp and sickly night city, not terribly modern. Colored dice, human pawns, and some small cards plop on top. “This game's called Murder on Cobblestone. Basically, yeah there's a bunch of rules you could read in this pamphlet, but the idea is our characters in it are investigators have some possible scripted events and tasks in the city that we accomplish with dice rolls, having the characters share information, maybe dealing with some villains...” She joins Silver and sips wine too.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Murder on Cobblestone, a wonderful name for a game. I applaud whoever comes up with these." She takes yet another sip, and then sets the glass down to analyze the board more curiously. She takes a blue piece off the board and holds it between her fingers. "Are these any real significances to the colors or may I claim this one for myself?" 
		<p>
		Her instinct is to read over the rules in meticulous detail, but wasting half an hour of their precious time doing that in silence seems very not productive to having a social evening so she'll follow along with Shape's leaning towards winging it, maybe.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape scans the rules, murmuring, “Don't see why not. You're the blue piece then. Is your character the kind that'd... hold a flintlock, or a knife, or maybe just sneak up and strangle with a rope?” Shape wasn't going to waste a whole the evening away to precise rulings, no. The gameplay loop was simple enough once it got going. But, indeed, there were preliminary steps. Shape shuffles the small card decks and she says, “I want a gun, in any case. I'll take a flintlock. And maybe this perk for adjusting a roll once every three turns.” She points out the starting choices for character abilities and single tool. She pulls the table a bit closer to the couch with both of them.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I think doubling up sounds not conducive to learning the varieties of gameplay, so I will let my dear Miss Blueston have a knife. If your rules say she can't be a Miss, those are bad rules." She scans across the list of perks. "Ah, yes. I think I will settle for the double move on rolling a one or a two. Sounds like excellent insurance for whatever manner of moving this game might need." 
		<p>
		It's a peculiar change of nature for Silver to suddenly seem quite invested in playing a silly board game, but it suits her well and she doesn't seem to mind it at all.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“Yeah. I guess I'm doing green. I'll name her... Tea. Lady Tea.” Shape giggles, and she plants their pawns at the starting position, a police station. “Yeah, no, modern board games are the darnest things, they'll even specify in the rules for ones like this usually that male and female characters are evenly attributed. We can be ladies, legally.” She sips from her wine and reads off a card, and rolls a dice. “The crime was conducted to the beloved barber! He was cut into three pieces, and there's like this long trail of blood in some photos Tea can see that goes from the middle of the street to the alley they found him.” She hands Silver a card and the dice. “Your character could probably get some more insight too, and maybe we can solve a puzzle at the crime or just snoop for witnesses?” 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver feigns a quite shocked gasp at the revelation of the murder. "Oh no, not the beloved barber! Let's see here..." She rolls a dice and scans the card herself, raising an eyebrow. "So, it seems that some of the barber's tools are bloodied, but none of them seem large enough to actually commit the act of, you know." She makes a scissor cutting motion indicating the fact of how not in one piece he is. 
		<p>
		"How recent is this, would you say? I think if it's quite fresh we must investigate the scene before it is too late. Certainly in the weather that seems to permeate this city as well." Silver gently puts the card back onto the table, face down. Shape should know what to do with it.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape simply discards that card and the previous card into a new pile, facing down still. And after a couple minutes of awkward turns passing buildings in the evening light and greeting the crime scene, Lady Tea and Miss Blueston have found a cypher rolled up in a paper in the barber's sleeve. Shape comments, “I would have not been that observant in a million years, but I guess that's what having a roll of 4 is like. But yeah, good idea to check the scene. I wonder what the... jumbled letters could mean. I guess we should see if there's something we could find like an encryption key?” Lady Tea, once she's finished showing Miss Blueston the original encryption paper, writes a copy on a slip of paper in her notebook, rips it out, and... puts it between her tits, to quote Shape.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Miss Blueston raises an eyebrow at her colleague's choice of storage, but it's as useful as any, surely. The two of them return to the barbershop, in case there's things to deduce about the purpose of the crime or how it was committed. "Say, what exactly are we racing or wagering against in this game? Or is this truly just a leisurely murder mystery we'll see through to the end?" She realizes she's finished her glass as she goes to take another sip, and seems a tad surprised by this. The entire edge of the glass is stained in small amounts of shimmering silver, but it looks more ornately decorated than stained at a quick glance.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape heads to the kitchen and returns with the wine bottle, saying in the meantime, “In this game, there's kind of a multi-layered losing condition, you can sort of think of it less like losing and more having worse and worse wins. The best possible win being maybe that we manage to stop the criminal from killing anyone else when we capture them quickly. We have like 40 turns for that or something, so a large amount of time still, yeah.” She goes ahead and tips the bottle of wine for Silver's glass, not really expecting her to drink much more but wanting to present opulence in providing it. And, yeah, Shape drinks more from her own glass and pours into her own. Miss Blueston is the first to notice that one of the chairs is both the only chair pulled out from the barber mirror and hair products and the only chair with a large clump of black hair. Tea finds the hair spray is freshly opened, and the cutting tools are missing. “I guess the barber took the tools to the crime site,” Shape says. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver doesn't have time to consider if she wants to object to more wine. Respectfully, she takes one more little nip at the liquid. "I see, then. Black hair— that should narrow things down somewhat, though... It's a shame this isn't the kind of time where people frequently have vivid and distinct hairs. A suspected killer with purple hair would be much more distinct." Miss Blueston pockets some locks of the hair, and takes Lady Tea's hand to lead the pair back to the scene. Probably not the most time efficient approach, but leads are somewhat linear so far and it seems obvious to her to pursue those.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape says, “Ah, you're a fan of vivid hair colors and stuff? I'll have to keep that in mind maybe. Maybe I could take a request.” She seems to speak just a bit looser. Tea happily walks along Miss Blueston's side, even leaning on her a bit at the crime scene. Unfortunately, the hair and hairspray didn't shed a ton of light on the scene. However, a man from the police station at the scene tips them some of the suspected witnesses, including some bar guests across the street of the alley. Lady Tea walks closely with Blueston to the bar and inquires the bartender if he was there last night, too.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Say, as we're doing such good parts being in character, I do wonder how green would suit you. You could be my very own Lady Tea, in person." She giggles, amusedly. The bar is quite dusty and stuffy, and Miss Blueston takes on Silver's confidence of being quite upfront, asking more broadly if anyone in the bar has seen anything pertaining to last night's happenstances. 
		<p>
		The bartender had been working here last night, but was largely distracted due to two instances of patrons having quite some disagreements. Only one person of the second pair is mentioned to have black hair. Lucas something or other, his name, and he is distinctly not present today. Some other people second these scuffles, and one other person claims to vaguely recall curious sounds on the way home last night but was too drunk to have much detail or remember when this was.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“Green? Yeah, sure, I can do that. Give me just a second, Silver.” Shape leans back into the couch and disassociates from the game and her surroundings. And Shape's head of hair develops a strange fog of sand-colored particles, and then her outfit also is wrapped in a thin layer of this dust. In just a few seconds, Shape's hair and dress are entirely the light green found in the game. And she adjusts her eyes afterward to fit that color, as an afterthought. “Lady Tea, at your service.” She leans back into the board and smiles. Silver has a sexy giggle.
		<p>
		Lady Tea suggests to Miss Blueston that they should see if police records exist for Lucas and possibly the bartender. Then Tea suggests that the way the blood trail disappears into the street might be an indicator that the perpetrator owned a vehicle of some variety. Bar attendees, surprisingly, give a response about the vehicle Lucas drove. And so, excitedly, Tea asks if they passed a house or building with that vehicle. Shape drinks and shrugs. “It's totally Lucas.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver leans in, observing with a distinct amazement. She's so used to being underhanded, subtle, and secretive about her means and has little experience otherwise. Seeing someone else actually perform and lean into magical acts strikes her in a most peculiar way. She eyes the results very approvingly, and gives a smile in return. "That is... Hm. Wow. You did announce it and everything but it really isn't something I was quite prepared for." She takes an almost nervous sip of drink. "Is magic... Always so beautiful, or is that just you?" 
		<p>
		Miss Blueston nods along with the comments and notes but she seems much more absent than two turns ago. When realizing that Tea asked about the car, she has to admit that she's not entirely sure what the premise of the question was in the first place.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape glances up from the board once more, and sits up. Slowly. She sips again and stretches her arms back. “Nobody's ever prepared for my magic. It's quality stuff. And it's not just the magic, Silver, dear. Thank you for your very, very kind words.” A bit of the wine drips out of the cup. She brings it forward again on the table. And she continues to smile. “You're beautiful yourself. Like... Ivory, in business casual.” She pushes the cup against the board, toppling over one of the card stacks, and she picks up after the small mess. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Miss Blueston simply continues to wait in silence for Lady Tea's response but the pair seem like they're frozen in time, somehow. 
		<p>
		Silver, too, takes a small sip of the wine, seeming very struck still. "I wish I got to see magic more often, now. Even as someone with it, I tend to simply stick with the belief that it doesn't exist to avoid giving things away when I shouldn't. I have to pretend it's a secret to me too. It's almost like being ashamed of it, as if acknowledging it is a mistake. Not that I've met anyone else with such capacities before you. Maybe if I knew it was more proliferated from the start I'd have seen things differently." The various green details of the recolored Shape keep catching Silver's eyes, as if the fact that this is still the same person that was before here only minutes ago is repeatedly a major surprise.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape finishes the card stack, and she scoots on the floor a bit from her side of the table and more to Silver's. She nods, and says facing Silver, “Hmmm. That sucks. I don't like to pretend it doesn't exist to people that much, like sure I pretend right but like... It's only for my protection, when I know it's safe or I can enchant someone's life for the better I like to... Stick with me though I'll show you more magic. Lots more magic than even mine out there. You'll see.” She sighs, and she rests her shoulder on the table. “I know I got totally mad the other day but. It's not a secret anymore. Your magic is safe here if you want to twirl... Any sorts of conjuring. What do you do again? It's like mind stuff and what else?”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Lots more magic? You have my curiosity. What kinds of magics could you show me?" Silver stops to think. It's a little bit slower and less effective than usual. How much wine did she have already? More than intended, but whatever. "What I do is... Fairly diverse, in the range of thought alteration. But that's the only thing I have. I call it the Silver Tongue, and I can use it to speak directly into people's minds. The strength of it depends on how strongly I apply it; trying to hide it and make sure people do not notice means I can only be strongly persuasive in the moment usually. I can bypass this to some degree with eye contact. But if I raise my voice and let my magic really flow, I can do very severe things to people. Captivate them for longer times, override memories on a lasting manner lest they find a way to pry at inconsistencies and break the illusion. Being alone with someone or affecting everyone present means I have that freedom, since I can then amend their observations of the act... I got a bit carried away, maybe? You asked, and I've never had much chance to talk about this to someone else." She takes another drink to stifle her awkwardness- and then realizes she did intend to not do more of that. Oh well.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“Oh, you know, like there's witches and elves and dragons, maybe some gods, there's like weird objects that have magical properties right, but most of them are kinda specific and unruly, a rare couple aren't but usually those are safe kept yeah. Don't have great experiences over all with objects. But like say you wanted me to do weird mind or body stuff to a much more limited-- extent, I could probably figure a way to make that happen.” She sighs and arrives at Silver's side of the table, and she rests her back partially atop of it. “Wow... The Silver Tongue. Even as focused of an ability as it is, that's very powerful and-- diverse yeah. Really cool, really wicked. I can definitely see how you're so persuasive. Have I've already been persuaded?” She giggles and shakes her head. “No, though, I'm pretty sure here it's your charisma. Your charm... I'd know otherwise because I'd sense the presence of your Silver Tongue... I'm glad you feel comfortable with the opportunity to share. Honestly, so much of your person is going to be also in your magic and how you use it. We are magic people. There's no avoiding that being a factor. In us.” 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I haven't attempted to influence you past the one unfortunate and overly instinctive moment, so far. Not only because you seem one to notice if I were to, but... I did promise. If you are curious though, I could... Demonstrate." 
		<p>
		The thought of Vera crosses her mind. She doesn't want to consider that right now, though, and shakes it off. Her hand moves closer to Shape, and ends up gently resting on her knee as that's the part of her Silver can currently reach.  "Magical objects, hmm. I'd be very curious about such things. There's bound to be some that are awfully convenient and would be useful to have... Ah, I'm scheming again. I am awfully results oriented at time, as you may have noticed."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape shakes her head and grins. “Be curious all you want, then~. I don't have to show you any of the magical objects if I don't want. You'd have to make me. And, yes, there are some that are quite convenient and quite accessible. Hmm?” She stares at Silver from this skewered perspective, and adjusts her knee into the hand. She says, “Thank you for not having attempted since then. I am, though, just a bit curious... I have to admit, I have never felt cozier with someone so manipulative. Such a wonderful collection of features and skills you have.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"...Show them? Hmm. Does that mean you actually have some of them yourself? That's very interesting. Well, then, my dear Shape. Ahem." She adds just the slightest suggestion to her voice. "Please, sit up, I can't demonstrate well without looking at you properly." 
		<p>
		Even if prompted, she feels a bit awkward at first doing so to Shape, but it's a very mild one. Not something she couldn't defy, just a strong inclination that it's a natural and good idea to sit up properly and look at Silver. 
		<p>
		"...How does that feel? I've heard some various odd descriptors thrown about but not from anyone who expects it."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape hums, and she sits up onto the edge of the table properly. It... Should have enough support for old her. She looks into Silver's eyes, and shrugs. “Sure thing, boss... Tell you what, it feels like. I don't know, like an alternative voice of reason. Like you've placed yourself in the part of my head that makes subconscious ideas happen and then finally thoughts about what to do.” She pauses, and she puts her hand on the one Silver has on her knee. “It feels imposing, warm like an electric lamp, sexy-- well, you know, more than mine.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver takes mental notes of this. She isn't going to let an opportunity to do actual science on her own powers pass unused. “Curious, and very insightful. Speaking of curiosity... You did say that you won't share with me your magical oddments but. Oh, I am so curious, I simply must see them. Magic is so beautiful, isn't it? Tonight is all about sharing this magic, it seems, so why don't we take a look at what other magical curiosities you may present~?” There's again a warm static connecting Silver's eyes and Shape's eyes, and she doesn't even try to conceal the magical aspect of it, though she's aware she laid on thick with the appeal to natural agreement as opposed to just commanding Shape. 
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape's eyes stay locked on Silver throughout her carefully worded poem of enchanted thought. It never truly became unwilling, and yet it never was something Shape wanted to give to her without casual resistance, access to these magical items “that she may present.” But... From the ease of which Shape guided her influence into her mind for this one, Shape now agreed. She moves from the table, guiding her feet to a stand, and says, “I have to admit, Silver, I'd be delighted to share them with you tonight. All magic really is beautiful.” She continues to hold Silver's hand, though, as she walks with Silver to the stairway. She smirks. “It's in my bedroom, dear.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver stands up, taking the lead she herself had guided, like a carriage following a horse. In the end, the carriage decides the way after all. The holding of hands is genuine, though, and while she's well familiar with people following her orders, this time it's so distinctly different. She had, in turn, been baited into applying this influence most deliberately by Shape, and there was no secret about it. Like a game, and not a business endeavor. 
		<p>
		She does not know how to feel about this. 
		<p>
		"I do suppose a bedroom is a good place to hide away toys you don't want anyone and everyone to see." She muses in return.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape leads them up the stairway excitedly, almost tripping given her faint buzz. And when they reach the bedroom, Shape closes the door behind them with a click. She says, “Yeah. I'd describe potent magical artifacts as toys, too. In this case, though, I have two kinds in my house.” On the window frame under the beady night stars of the urban sky, a spear of a black, cold rod and green stony tip leans against the wall. A red ribbon wraps just below the stone, at the top of the rod. Shape walks over to it, holds it up, and keeps the tip away from Silver. “This was a gift. It will hurt, a lot, if you even so much as nick your finger on the green part of this. It's like being set on fire around the area of contact. I never got used to the feeling.” Then Shape places the spear back and walks to the closet across from her dark-blanketed bed. She gets onto her knees and dials a combination lock on a safe, and produces three brilliant stones. Purple, red, and orange, differently jagged and glowing like salt lamps. She sits atop the bed with these strange rocks strewn about the cover beside her, and she plops her legs across the cover. “These are rune stones. The purple one lets you change bodies, the red one lets you change minds, and the orange one lets you swap bodies. Think Freaky Friday. Here's the thing though, it only works if both the person activating the change and the person receiving the change hold the stone at the same time. They also have to agree to the effect, basically.” She blinks. “You never even asked I explain them, for the record. I'm just being helpful.” 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver watches the spear with a curious gaze, almost seeming a bit disappointed that it simply does not look largely magical from the outside. She has no intents of actually assuring herself that it's magically unpleasant and nasty, and takes Shape's word for it. The rocks, however, fill that visual gap much better - Silver sits down a respectable distance from Shape and leans in to get a closer look, though she's very wary not to touch them. She has absolutely no experience with artefacts, after all, so even Shape's description of its use doesn't immediately dispel her concern. 
		<p>
		"Changing minds, changing bodies... What a coincidence that this is exactly what we two are already good at." She giggles notably more than she usually would, given her influence. "Changing bodies... I wonder, I really do. I never got to truly find out if my Silver Tongue is tied to the body, or to the mind. I know it gets much weaker if my voice gives out, or I have a cold." She would not have said such a thing on most days, but wine and newfound fascination for magic are a potent combination.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape starts climbing into the bed covers and sheets, of course entirely without prompt. She stows the rune stones under the covers, and she starts taking her green dress off, her white skirt intact. “It's too warm if I wear this under my blanket... Oh, the orange one, yeah, that one is something neither of us can really do, yeah. Or I guess technically the red one lets me change your body or, say, make you think I'm actually funny. But I'm not interested in that.” She tosses her dress aside onto the ground, and bundles her bra-clad chest to the cover. She tugs the portion of it under where Silver is sitting. “You're welcome to join me if you like, Silver... And umm. I think your Silver Tongue, maybe, is tied to the body, if you struggle with a cold. I struggle to shapeshift under the weather, and it's in the blood. You don't want my powers, though; you'd have trouble with them.” 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Shape's transformation to a bedded state is unexpected, and Silver seems somewhat startled. Nonetheless, she does make herself comfortable by taking her heels and jacket off, using a short trip to Shape's desk for depositing as an excuse to let her pull the blanket in properly. "The blood? Hm. An odd place to keep magic, but I do suppose it makes sense. It's, in a sense, the very essence of your body." Silver allows herself into the bed as well, a respectable foot of distance to start. Her hair covers quite much of the pillow and she takes some effort to brush it into a useful position as she turns to face her company. "I'd almost believe you've been affecting me this time, I feel honestly much more comfortable than I'd assume after all this."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape smiles at Silver a most warm smile, and she honors Silver's space despite this blessing. She says, “Yeah. I wish I knew why my blood was that way.” She rests her left ear on the pillow, and she doesn't bother adjusting her green hair, although there's much less of it. “I'm really glad you feel comfortable. What I've done is no magic, no spell, no trick. I simply am getting to know you, having a bit of fun with you, and showing my true colors-- to you.” She closes her eyes slowly, and keeps them closed. “We are magic, but we are so much more than that too... You're not just an enchanted tongue. I'm not sure if I'm drunk and you're drunk, but I hope you remember everything, especially that.” And say goodbye when she has to leave. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I have to admit I didn't intend to get this much wine but I do suppose it may have helped some things along, for better or for worse. I'll care about that what the time comes to do so." She can't help but be amused at the mention of colors, emphasizing it with a short run of her fingers through Shape's hair. "I think I am some ways from being blacked out in the morning, don't you worry." She eases herself into a rest as well... The thought of forgetting the night brings her back to thinking about Vera. Getting drunk enough to lose memory would be somewhat of the same thing, she supposes.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		----------------------------------------
		<br>
		Shape holds her forehead and stretches her legs, many hours later. She realizes she's forgotten to discard the rune stones back to the safe, so she quietly grabs the stones individually and tucks them under the bed on her side. And she watches as this sort of stirring has disturbed Silver's delicate rest. She addresses her with a smile, and she says, “Well, it's nothing fancy here but I hope you had a good rest. Hey Silver.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver shifts slightly, and makes some kind of snoozy noise. The realization that she's gone to sleep in all her clothes makes her awaken slightly faster. 
		<p>
		"Mmh? What? Shape?" She stretches, and slowly sits up while trying to recollect the peculiar position she's found herself in.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape giggles. And she sits up a bit more against the back of the bed, onto her pillow. “We got a bit sleepy and went to bed is all, so I was just hoping it was a cozy bed. Maybe some good dreams... Last night was fun! We got to know each other a bit, we got to see some casual magic. We played that board game.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver gently rubs her eyes out, and eyes over the green lady beside her. "Magic..." The details are coming back, and she feels some amounts of unwell at the realization of things she said, of how much wine she had, how detailed her various descriptions were. This wasn't like Silver. 
		<p>
		"It was... Something, I suppose." She rubs her arm in a somewhat awkward manner.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		“Yeah. It was.” Shape blinks, and then she glances around the somewhat sparse room. There's not even a poster on the wall. “You must be hungry. I'll go run downstairs and make us a spot of breakfast. What do you like to eat, Silver? For this time, anyway... Maybe an early lunch instead of breakfast if you want too.” Shape climbs out of the sheets and bed gingerly, her bra strap stretched over her back in clear view of Silver.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I... Don't really know. Anything will do, probably." Silver climbs out the other side of the bed, and looks over her clothes. She does not feel very presentable, having slept in them instead of some proper nightwear. "I might not even be that hungry." 
		<p>
		She isn't very subtle about seeming off. She pulls out her phone and does a habitual check for appointments, messages and the likes.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape walks to Silver's side of the room, and she yawns. She gazes at Silver again by the door with her green eyes. “Hey, Silver, is everything all right? You seem... I guess distracted, maybe sad? I'm here for you, you know. I'm your friend. And maybe I have a few years of experience too you know.” She brushes her hair from her lips.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		She sits down on the bedside again, and sighs most deeply. "I said so many things, yesterday. Too much, I feel. I was just caught up in things. And I usually do not like drinking as much. I'm not even sure I was really being myself, in the end. That isn't how things are meant to be. I'm rambling, and I don't ramble often." She doesn't seem to be faring better from talking so much about it, appearing slightly stressed as a result instead. "Maybe I should just be alone soon so I can think."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape leans against the door and breathes in deeply in return. Her fingers wander into each other. “Hmm. I'm sorry about the drinking. Next time we should probably avoid that, yeah. But I don't think it affected you that much, I mean... Maybe you like to ramble in my presence, you know? Maybe that's just what we do as people who've gotten to know each other a little. I of course... Tend to ramble myself.” Shape, now, returns a sigh. “I don't know much still. I only learned a bit more about your magic. I think that's okay. You know way more about me in comparison. Like the magic rune stones.”
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver makes a very low groan, and rubs her forehead with some fingers. "No, this isn't right. I'm incredibly stuck up and secretive about these details usually. Your magic, your... Rune stones... Did you do this? Did you make me talk?" She doesn't face Shape to ask this. It's less a direct accusation and more exploring of options she seems possible. Silver's arms cross over her stomach. She doesn't feel pleasant at all.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape frowns. She continues staring at her, whether or not she'll return a gaze, and she says with little charisma, "I'm many things, Silver, but a liar isn't one of them. I'm not doing shit to you... You wanted to see the rune stones, I wasn't going to show them to you and then you made me show them to you. That's on you. I didn't use them. And that's not how they work anyway. You'd have to agree to their effects if you were to be changed by any." She grabs her own knees, leaning forward. "I really just think we had a good time together. And I was open and so you felt you could be too. Is that so hard to believe? Friends sharing stuff about their lives. Trying to be friends."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver reaches out, to Shape's cheek. It's a soft gesture. "That's the problem. I don't believe things. I know things, or I don't know them. And if I don't know, I find out. Believing causes issues." 
		<p>
		She quite firmly but not unkindly turns Shape's head to face her own meeting eyes, and there's a growing crackle of magic... But the only thing that comes out as the opens her mouth is a sudden sob. She lets go, wraps her arms around Shape instead, and leans her head awkwardly into her shoulder as she starts crying. "I promised..."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape felt a spike of her magic blood, a rush of warmth, when Silver's eyes came to meet her own. But it had nowhere, after all, to resist Silver's Silver Tongue. Alarmed, stiff, Shape places her hands on Silver's upper body, behind her shoulders, and rubs with her right hand in a slow, circular motion. She stammers, and then says, "I... I've been where you are. I've not trusted people. People have hurt me. You shouldn't feel forced to believe anything, but..." Shape's shoulders relax, and she sighs. "I didn't mean to make you cry..."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver shakes her head. "You didn't make me cry. I made myself cry. Maybe you're right... Maybe it was just a nice evening. Maybe I did feel like telling you these things. I wish it were easier to accept that. I've grown outright paranoid, haven't I? It feels like such a necessary, healthy concern usually but also usually it doesn't get in the way of? Proper friendship, I suppose? I've never met someone quite like you." 
		<p>
		Silver teases a handkerchief out of her pocket and blows her nose in it before lying back on the bed and closing her eyes. There is not too much left of her general elegant nature, face marked by crying and her posture somewhat curled up in a wary and uncomfortable manner.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape watches Silver lie down and curl. She keeps trying to think of the right things to say... And she goes closer to the bed and covers Silver with a bit of blanket up to her shoulders, finally coming to words. "I wish people didn't lie, sometimes. You know there's a movie where the premise is that nobody's learned to lie? I know that couldn't be good, either, always telling the truth, but... It'd be better than this... putting such doubts in you. I've never met someone like you either... Wait right here, please." Shape escapes the bedroom, holding her head as she darts down the stairs. She prepares water and some oatmeal for Silver. She never felt so uncomfortable in her bedroom.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		She doesn't say much to this little monologue, simply letting Shape take her leave. The blanket is nice, and she settles in a bit more comfortably below it. Other people always being honest by nature would be very practical, but the idea of having to do the same herself would greatly outweigh that. Would she be capable of such? She's not sure. She's lived off secrets and misdirection. What if she could change that...? What if she could be in a position where she simply didn't need to lie any more? There are a few ways to achieve that, certainly. Of very different flavors of ethical and good. She lets her mind spiral a bit on this thought, it's better than being upset by the here and now.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape comes back into the room with a bowl of cinnamon apple oatmeal and a glass of water, although the oatmeal is of course the box kind with the flavored sugar packet. She places the oatmeal and fork atop of Silver and the blanket, and then she sits beside Silver on the bed, holding the glass. "This water is for you. I'll hold it so it doesn't spill." She stares at Silver's eyes, open or closed. She wants to show that trust-- treat thy neighbor like she wants to be treated, but especially if you make it obvious. "If there's anything else I can do for you, I will. Was thinking that... You deserve to see more evidence I'm on your side, I guess?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver carefully sits up, and takes the presented meal. She pries into it and has a small forkful. "Thank you... You're awfully kind to me. I suppose I've been missing out if having people be friendly and genuine is this good." She giggles halfheartedly. "It's not the same when you, ahem, encourage people to be this friendly. What do you mean, evidence? What do you have in mind?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		She smiles and pulls some of her own green hair back from her eyes. "It's no problem. I really think kindness, well placed, does anyone well... Oh, for evidence, I mean like..." She tilts her head back, and makes a silly mumbling noise. "I'll continue to be helpful and supportive and friendly. I know you manipulate people, but you're not just permanently cold or anything... Or, hell, maybe you'd need my help sometimes? In this uncaring world, I would definitely need yours too."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Her eyes fall onto the green hair, and she can't resist reaching out and running a hand through it. "Working together, helping each other, like a detective duo. Maybe we could solve come crime. It's a shame I can't as easily adapt the blue, I'm quite attached to the whole being silver thing I have going on." She pauses, has some more meal. "I wouldn't constitute that as evidence, personally, but as I've implied I'm quite peculiar about being certain of things... What manner of things would I be able to help with? You seem to get along well, in general. Though maybe my sample size is just small."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape glimmers. "God, that game was a lot of fun. We'll have to finish it some time. I'll take a picture of the board later so we remember what we were doing... But, I suspect, we could solve crime, yes. I wouldn't mind if you stayed Silver for that." She flushes. The light beams through the window blinds grow more obtuse in angle as the sun rises higher. "Well, we'll work on the evidence then I suppose. I think I'd want to level with you and find the happy medium... As for helping me, it's a bit embarrassing to admit, but there's a few groups of people that historically I've been at their whims and fancies. Specifically there's this organization that's almost a bit of a cult that's obsessed with magical beings, and they've tried to capture me a whole lot. I haven't seen them in a couple years, but the last time I saw them they were right here in the city. I don't want to constantly move away or become unrecognizable physically all the time, even if I have the power." She glances through the window. "They call themselves Apotheosis... Also maybe the government of Germany doesn't like me either but I'm getting ahead of myself."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver blinks, twice. "Um."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Yeah," She says. "I was thinking that since you run a large operation that maybe you'd have some ability to influence figureheads of this group to leave me the hell alone. 'The one who calls themself Shape.' I swear that's the shit they've said about me... Or, yeah, I guess I could use help with some other stuff like the fact my bank account isn't doing so hot, but well, I shouldn't be asking for favors I should be getting I should be asking what favors I can do for you. Can't a person with as much magical expertise and experience, with physical shapeshifting ability, be of any use to you?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver looks down into her oatmeal. "If I didn't already have large interest in keeping my magics secret, I sure would now. There's fucking organizations that hunt magic people. I'd have my means to crush them if necessary, or at least severely hinder them. But. I already have enough issues to deal with." She puts the oatmeal aside. She's not hungry any more, and instead takes the glass of water. "Not to make our friendship or partnership too transactional, but... I could spare some money, no problem. People have tended to be more cooperative and reliable when I support them. Not saying I don't trust you without, but it'd probably put my mind more at ease for the time being."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape takes the oatmeal up from Silver's side, and nods. "Yeah, I agree that I don't want to make things about money. They're never really about money for me if I can avoid it. But, yeah, I guess it'd be putting my mind at ease too, and I'd certainly feel pretty cooperative if I wasn't already. We'll just play into that psychology, in other words." She hums, facing the bowl and twirling the fork inside. "There's so much about the magical world you have yet to learn, though, organizations like that just being another thing. I think you'd totally crush them, for the record. And I'd fucking smile about it." She faces Silver again. "Well. I'll text you the relevant bank info later. I guess.. Well, I'm an extrovert, but maybe you're more of an introvert. What did you want to do now?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		She can't help but smirk. Usually these subconscious effects of the mind are more secretive and one-sided, but as with many things involving Shape it's a whole other thing to do it openly and cooperatively. "That sounds like a plan, then. You'll have to figure out a roughly appropriate amount, I honestly am not good with things like reasonable, not-upper-class budgets. I'd probably give you an uncomfortably high amount if you made me choose." 
		<p>
		Silver finally puts the blanket aside, and stands up. "Well, usually when I get this far into a morning waking up in someone else's bed, I've either left by now or the person is awfully infatuated with me and... Oh, you know. Having serious mornings that lead to actual togetherness is not my strong suit. I haven't even checked my messages and business matters yet today, I've completely forgotten." 
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Yeah... I'll text you an amount later. It'll be extremely modest, don't worry. I've never really been rich and never needed to be. I guess I'd be buying fancy paintings like you if I had the money, I guess, and maybe also exotic food? But yeah. What is there for a person like me to purchase in luxury?" Shape shrugs and cozies partially into the blanket  herself as Silver stands. "I feel pretty infatuated, but I wouldn't say awfully, no. I guess if you need to check on the messages and business stuff I have a laptop I could let you borrow, or you could always head back and we'll just hang out again sometime soon? I'll just be bored once you're gone, if you go, but I'll find something. It's been a real treat."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I appreciate the offer, but... I can do these things on my phone, and there's plenty of accounts and software involved that I'd rather not put on other people's devices. I do suppose I could need the time to relax and think anyhow, but it's been... An under the line positive experience being here, thank you. Do message or call if there is anything." She walks over to Shape’s desk and puts down the water before putting her jacket on. She still feels rather scruffy from sleeping like this and mostly wants to go straight home so she can tend to this.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape rests her head back on the pillow, and she gazes at the corner of her eye at Silver. "Don't worry about locking the front door, I guess. Oh, and I will let you know if I need anything yeah. And maybe even want anything. I'm glad it's been positive, no problem." She covers part of her cheek in blanket and rolls on her side. "Hey, one more thing. You look great. Really good. And are intelligent." Maybe Shape will try to sleep another hour and a half.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver nods, and takes her depart. She stops by the living room, giving one last glance to the board game. She sighs, and leaves.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		----------------------------------------
		<br>
		Shape knocks on the door of Silver's manor, or at least what's probably Silver's manor. She did a bit of sleuthing, and then got confused by the website listings of dozens of homes, and then realized there was only a couple of good manors. And Shape already checked the first one, the old guy there was not pleased.
		<p>
		Shape's greeted by someone other than Silver once again, however, and so Shape sighs. "Hey. Does Silver live here? White hair, tall, pretty, and scary?" Shape's transformed this time to a more confident stature with flowing hair to the middle of her back. The dreams of Silver's opulence and manor tickled her. But, even so, the maid didn't quite have to look up to her face.

		There's a subtle hint of warmth to the maid, or one might just imagine it with the colors she represents outside of her fairly standard maid outfit. Nina doesn't seem to embody the traits of such fiery nature though, standing quite still and eyeing Shape's current self up and down. "You've come to the right place. She isn't expecting anyone, though. Who's asking for her time?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Oh, it's Shape. I met her like a couple weeks ago and I went with her to the art festival in town at the time. She bought one art piece there. I tried messaging her yesterday but she didn't respond, so I was worried and thought I might stop by. Is it alright if I come in?" The orange colors of the maid are interesting, but Shape doesn't think much of it. She tries to look around the maid for a more proper glimpse of the interior.
		</div><div class="wrap Nina_w"><p>
		"One moment please." The door closes on Shape, with little regard for her efforts to peek. It doesn't last long though, and this time, Shape is offered a slightly friendlier look. "Follow me. You may leave your shoes if you wish." A hand gestures to a suitable spot on their right, before Nina leads the way into a rather sizeable living room with Silver seated in the sofa.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Nina, bring us some tea, will you? Something red with berries, maybe." Silver receives a small nod and then Shape is left alone with her. 
		<p>
		"Hi, Shape. I saw you called yesterday." 
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape steps inside and places her shoes aside as offered, revealing the tip of her thigh high socks. She says to the maid, "Thank you for that. Nice to meet you." And, joining Silver on the side of the same couch, she nods and turns her attention to Silver. "I did. I had been a while since we talked and I was worried and also was thinking we could hang out again. How have you been since last time? Nina seems.. Nice."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Apologies, it was a busy day. I have been... Managing, I suppose. A lot to think about. Magic, interior design, getting some staff going as you can see. She's dutiful, certainly, does an excellent and particular job." Silver rubs the back of her head, as it slightly embarrassed or uncomfortable. She doesn't elaborate. "Say, Shape, how much do you believe in coincidences, versus fate or similar things?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Ah, alright... Yeah, I suppose there would be a lot to think about, yeah. And, yeah, I suppose with this much money and such a huge place you'd need a whole team really." Shape crosses her legs and sandwiches her waist between a pillow on back on the couch and the armrest. "I've met different reasons to believe in column a and column b. As stands, though, I'm convinced I exist for a reason-- that people have an intended destiny, you know?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver ponders this answer for a moment. "See, I ask for a very simple reason. People say lightning never strikes twice and such things, but... There's a good chance you'll see it in action anyhow while you're here, so I'll just let you know - Nina has magic as well. I honestly didn't want to believe it at first but she confided in me and I do have to take some measures to accommodate it."
		</div><div class="wrap Nina_w"><p>
		While being mentioned, Nina returns with a tray including a teapot and a pair of cups, and a small bowl of sugar. She sets it down on the table, entirely not seeming to mind her being talked about on such a personal level in her presence. "Anything else, Miss? I was planning to go over the living room right now but I don't intend to disturb so I am free for the time being - Oh, you did ask me to arrange some of your folders into the cabinets. Apologies for forgetting." She trails off again, without even awaiting an answer.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Lightning can definitely strike the same spot again. There was that one guy who was struck like eight times by lightning, and he didn't even die. But, uh, Nina's magic? That's sweet. What kind of measures, though? Because..." Shape smiles at Nina in her brief visitation of the girls once more. She pours herself tea from the teapot, ignoring the sugar and waiting for the tea to cool somewhat. She holds up the ornate little cup toward Nina walking away. "Well, that surely can't be how almost anybody would act by default. Couldn't you pay for good servants instead?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver seems almost insulted by Shape's implications. "I'm not restraining her magically in that sense, no. It really just means making sure she can take her time off to - Let's just say she's bad at expending her excess energies. And I do pay her very well, thank you very much. I'm not a complete animal, and I do care about the well-being of people who can't handle taking the butt end of a terrible business deal. I just... Can't trust anyone uninformed anywhere near my various personal files and devices without the proper precautions, you know? If I go and tell my staff 'if you go anywhere near these mysterious business records I'll fire you on the spot' I'm inviting problems. She won't remember too much the finer details of her job here when outside of the house but won't mind that, she'll be compensated well above expectations and have a wonderful reference for future jobs." 
		<p>
		Silver sighs. She knows what Shape is getting at, though, and there's just the tiniest itch scratching at her usual confidence in that it's a completely fine course of action to take.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape catches the edge on Silver's voice partway through her explanation, and she bows her head and sips her still very warm tea. She says, "Sorry, uh. I guess I just didn't have very much context. I think that makes sense, yeah. Especially if she's paid well and looks back on this positively herself and with her employer, there's not much too wrong or anything, in theory. I just, well, I guess.. Is Nina this sweet usually? Or is it sort of like job enhancement magic happening?" Shape fidgets, actually, and places the tea back on the tray. She whips her hair back again. "--That's probably fine either way... Also, yeah, not sure what her excess energy thing is, but power to her I suppose. Maybe I'll chat with her sometime, if she's on break later... Oh, uh, changing the subject maybe, I was thinking maybe we could watch a movie? I haven't seen a movie in ages. You probably  have a very nice setup."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver enjoys some tea as well, listening to Shape ramble. Her concerns and comments feel very conflicted, but there's not much to be done about it. "She's a very well-organized and dutiful lady. I didn't have to influence much at all... A movie, you say? I do enjoy those on occasion. What manner of do you like? I like things that are easy to simply put on and take in." She's already started prying at her TV setup, to browse for content.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Like are those subwoofers, right? Those lower speakers I mean." Shape feels more assured by her comment about Nina's behavior, and part of her knows that it might be inflated by her desire to hang out. On that note, Shape scoots a bit closer to Silver's side while she's browsing, within an outstretched arm's reach. "Yeah. I think I like comedy, action, probably weird movies too. Romance ones I guess can sometimes be a bit cheesy too much." Shape reads the descriptions of several movies they pass by on the streaming service, often being cut off in the first few words or sentence. 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I have to admit, often I just ask the internet what manner of Movies I should have seen already. It tends to work just fine... Oh, Revving through Time. I've seen that one. I heard it has sequels, actually. Have you seen those? I think they're good enough standalone titles that we can watch the second one, if you like." 
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Oh, actually, I only saw the first one too like.. Uh, a long time ago." Shape closes her eyes and giggles. "That's a classic. Let's see the second one of them, yeah... Does the TV have that as an option, that movie?" She sips from her tea again, this time it's at the perfect temperature.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I did get a subscription service with an extensive backwards log for the purpose of not having to sign up to too many more. It's not cheap, but. You know me." She pushes some buttons and does manage to navigate to the selected movie, quickly scanning the page for information. Weird time travel, science based magic-like happenstances. The idea of emulating magic through science has always fascinated her just a bit, it seems a good way to expand capabilities in a reliable way. 
		<p>
		"Should I just start it, or is there anything we should do first?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"We can just start... I guess a blanket would be cozy though. Not that it's cold, I just like blankets. In fact it could also be colder, if that's alright." She shrugs. Shape didn't think much of the time travel gimmick, on the other hand. She's seen just about every magic and science, and time travel hasn't been one of them. It's an anomaly of fiction, and a funny one.
		<p>
		Doctor Brock convincing the protagonist and some chick to go to the future on short notice got a laugh out of Shape. She then says, "Sure. Can't believe that time machine can be powered on soda." And when the car arrives in the future later, Shape hums, "They really tried to get the future right, didn't they...? They just arrived in our last decade! Weird to think I'm living beyond the future."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver takes a perceived downtime to move over to a cabinet and pull out a neatly folded blanket. With this much storage space and presumably excess blankets it's reasonable to have some at hand always. She sits back down, draping it over the two of them. "Time travel is a most odd means of finding new knowledge. And ruining it in the process, probably. These movies are pretty finicky about their timeline stuff, if I remember? So that's fun. I wonder how our future will look like? What manner of technologies will be around then." Silver muses at the idea of hover boards and such having been supposed to exist years ago.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape washes over with a sort of fuzziness when Silver ends up sharing the requested blanket with her. She smiles between Silver and the television, and she's bundled inside the blanket from hands, shoulders, to legs. "Yeah, I agree it just seems like a pretty bad way of learning about the past or maybe even the future since you're actively going to change it in the process. But whatever. I guess... Glad we didn't get rid of classic American diners in the future, haha just kidding... Those were always so nice." She sighs. "Not sure what the future holds in general. I just hope I can do my part and give a hand."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		There's a slight silence, and then Silver carefully seeks out Shape's hand. "Give a hand, you say... Oh, a sports almanac? I can see this going terribly." Silver seems a tad captivated in thought at the movie, but the two of them are interrupted by small knock on the wall.
		</div><div class="wrap Nina_w"><p>
		Nina is back, seeming some manner of uncomfortable, maybe even aching. There's a distinct warmth to her even at some distance. "Miss, I didn't wish to interrupt but I do need to take a break." It's not a question, and she's slowly headed for the back door to the secluded back yard.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I told you, Nina, if you must then you must. You really shouldn't push it just to avoid disturbing me and my company." She waves the maid away and then rewinds the last minute of the movie.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape says before Nina can really turn around, although she left anyway, "I didn't think you were disturbing us. It's fine, we're talking over the movie anyway." She sighs and takes up Silver's hand, accepting the silent offer. "I can actually sense Nina's magic pretty well from how strong it is around us. It's like… Solar or fire? Huh..." She bites her lip and glances back at where Nina left to. She wonders what Nina’s urgency in her break was—the struggle in her tone almost lost to the noise of the movie. "Actually, is it alright if I talk to Nina while she's on break for a second? I'd love another magical acquaintance. And all." 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver takes Shape's hand a bit more firmly. "I would recommend not doing that now - You could have a chat later but a break really isn't a good time to disturb her." Silver pauses the movie and indicates to the glass door. Vague flashes of light and the sound of fire can be heard now that the movie isn't overriding it. "She's got a very fiery spirit, but only in the magical sense. Her stoic, organized and mild-mannered nature means it cooks up inside her, building pressure. If she doesn't take the time to expend it on occasion, it can cause pains and irritability. I let her tend to it, she said that if it goes for too long she can have less voluntary outbursts of fire and anger. I feel a bit sorry for her, but she takes it very well. And I do what I can to help." She keeps holding tightly onto Shape's hand, and resumes the movie.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Her eyes widen between Silver's narration and the distant fireworks. She says, careful to not interrupt the film, "Oh. I'm with you on that-- I feel sorry for her too. Her magic seems less than desired from the sounds of it? But who knows, maybe she has her moments. Or maybe she'd do well with a bit of adventuring? I used to do some of that more. I think that might be a good way for a powerful fire person like her to unwind to... Greater effect." She finds herself less engaged by the glass door, and takes to staring at the movie again. She sits even just a bit closer to Silver so that their hands can rest on the couch cushion. "I couldn't imagine having involuntary powers."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		The movie continues passing, to mixed interest from Silver. It's definitely what you would loosely expect from time travel mainstream fiction, but it's enjoyable enough. "She wouldn't be a maid if she cared to do actual things with her powers. It's her choice to simply tolerate the effects, and I will respect that." She sighs. "I don't understand it either, though. You know me; I use my powers to a large extent and would certainly try to find some beneficial applications with other powers too. Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like if I was much, much more powerful. The possibilities would be endless... Almost too endless, you know? But it's a bit exciting to imagine."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		She blinks at the television, witnessing the chaos of the future home for the protagonist and an old man scheming to steal the time machine. "Yeah. I guess that's true. She could have just been adventuring already if she wanted to, or something... And yeah, I guess with you tend to be more focused on using your magic and yeah I saw you eyeing those rune stones certainly. I think I used to be more like you, I think I mentioned that a while ago, where I was more eager to push the envelope with magic, but I don't know. I'm content with my abilities... If it's any solace from your daydreaming, I think you're very powerful already. Even exceeding just having powerful magic, wealth, and that other kind of power that wealth brings." She smiles. "At least I'm always on your side of the field."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver sighs gently. She does sometimes itch for more, but Shape is right. She is, all things considered, incredibly potent. Most powers wouldn't be able to get her to where she stands, so cleanly and so subtly. Maybe something like time traveling and obtaining an almanac would be more potent, but that sounds almost too easy... Okay, the movie is proving exactly that point for her as she thinks of it. "God, what a mess one single book can make. Time travel is such amazing stuff. It's probably for the better we don't have much access to it though."
		</div><div class="wrap Nina_w"><p>
		Nina quietly returns, looking a bit disheveled but at least her discomfort has quieted and she's back to her stoic and resolved nature. "I'll tidy myself up quickly, and I'll be back to the files after." She vanishes out the door and heads upstairs. 
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Yeah, if time travel was real and it was even a quarter as dangerous as it is in these films, there's no way I'm getting involved. And more accurately, I'd try to prevent others tampering with it too. I don't think the butterfly effect or logical paradoxes would help even evil people trying to get an advantage using time travel, after all." She gazes over to Silver's eyes, and she says, "Unrelated but-- did you like my look? You never really mentioned."
		<p>
		Shape calls out to Nina, and her voice tapers off, "You're really cool by the way... I like your stuff."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Oh yes, you look wonderful today, dear. Shapeshifting can only get you so far without a good taste to match and you certainly have that going for you too." Silver doesn't pay Nina much mind at all, but then ponders something. "Seeing as you're meeting her in my house... I'm not sure how well she'll remember you outside. Should I make you an exception for that? If not, you should be aware that she might just not recognize you and think it awkward if you try to act familiar."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Aww. I was almost a bit worried you'd be intimidated by the stature, but I knew better than that. Glad you think my taste is good." Shape lifts her end of the blanket to readjust things, and in the end she is brushing Silver's side with her own. It's something to be criticized certainly, but Shape couldn't resist the chance at some closeness. She says, "I'd like to be remembered by Nina, of course. I'd hate to fulfill that awkward exchange otherwise. She just seems really cute and friendly."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		It's a curious development of things, but Silver doesn't object after some thought and allows some slight lean in return. Might as well be a bit cozier. Dramatic things are happening in the movie, and she falls a bit quiet just paying attention to all the complicated details. "They certainly put a lot of attention to detail into this movie, didn't they?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape closes her eyes for a moment, just appreciating Silver not being mortified. She sees that the protagonist managed to wind up in the time and place of the first movie of the franchise, fighting for his right to continue existing from a future-cognizant young version of that other old person... Quite the struggle. "Yeah. I think movies in this time were pretty amazing about that. It was maybe more obvious when a movie was poorly written back then, they put so much love into the better ones."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver almost winces ever so slightly when the almanac is burned. In the movie, with the characters it makes sense, but... It's a potent object. It almost feels like a waste, against her better judgement. "Well, I do suppose that resolves things - Oh, or not. What an opportune time for lightning to happen." She seems quite amused by this entirely random outcome of events.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Bruh," Shape says, before entering a fit of laughter. "The time machine just goes away? Rip Matthew I guess. Doomed to be bros with his teenage father." The movie, though, presents the protagonist a letter from a confused postal worker, an envelope written nearly two-hundred years ago about returning from the 1950s to the present time… "Yeah this is a bit confusing. Some circular-logic shit for sure. But that was fun, it's over?" The credits are rolling, somewhat to her dismay. She leans on Silver comfortably. "I'm not moving. Anyway I liked the early future stuff. The diner and the hover boards. That was a cool part of the movie. What'd you like?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I liked the part with the Arcade Machine. Such a silly detail of the future, to have kids displeased by the use of physical effort in a video game. It's curious that we're years past that and still need to actually put in effort for games. Don't worry, you can stay here for some more time if you like." She places an arm around Shape, having let go of her hand some time during the movie.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		She has a hard time shaking off the obvious grin and a hint of pink cheeks. She says, "It's just been a long time since someone held me. I really haven't even tried in so long. And then there was that day in the cafe. I just really was inspired by you. Then Vera kinda ruined it. But it worked out." She closes her eyes again. "Sorry if that's too much information. I agree that the arcade machine scene was cute and funny. Using hands is like a baby toy..."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Aw, I'd almost suspect you're falling for me a bit. You're quite pleasant too, surely. I... have grown accustomed to being fallen for a lot. My habit of finding new people and occupying my time with them, being fairly good looking and having money means that I draw interest almost too easily. So I don't even think about it that much." Her mind again falls to having messed with Vera. Shape is right; things did work out probably because she chose to do so, without some closer privacy maybe the two wouldn't have moved on further.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Falling for you would be very silly. I've not known you long enough, perhaps. And perhaps you're very out of my league with this mansion and wealth stuff, and with ambitions. But then again so am I from you in my own ways, like having decades of magical context. Probably wanting different stuff. And you certainly have met so many people before. Many excellent." She hums, and she nuzzles the shoulder. "Thank you for finding me so pleasant."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I do suppose some of them have been quite excellent. Almost a shame I rarely ever get to meet any as well as I have with you." Her hand rubs up and down Shape's side slowly. "The movie's over though... What now, hmm? We could just sit like this for a while but not truly forever."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape nods gently, and she says in the softest tone yet, "Give me just a bit." Her body entirely relaxes in the course of a couple minutes. And she’s not responding with soft murmurs to Silver's words anymore: she’s managed to fall asleep. Movies and friendly rubs tend to have that effect on her.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver is, admittedly, wholly unprepared for this development. Apparently, they'll be sitting like this for longer than she anticipated. Shape had awoken before her, in Shape's bed, so Silver as no idea how deep the sleep is and if she'll have a chance to slink away eventually. 
		<p>
		It's comfortable for now though. She sighs.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		----------------------------------------
		<br>
		Shape wakes up with the blanket loosely covering her, and the light coming from the windows has been all but boiled away by the passage of time. Silver is nowhere to be seen. She says, rubbing her eyes, "Silver? Silver." And she walks outside the living room in idle wandering, finding Nina in the kitchen. Shape leans against the counter. "Hey. Where'd Silver go? And what's that smell?"
		</div><div class="wrap Nina_w"><p>
		Nina stirs a reasonably sized pot, looking up and turning around at Shape's voice. "Oh, you're awake. Silver is in her office, checking on the files I sorted in and doing some paperwork." Her expression seems very briefly puzzled, but it's dismissed quickly. "Considering how long you were asleep, she thought it'd be kind to include you in the dinner planning, so feel free to stay around for that. She wasn't sure what exactly would be in your taste and settled on a very classic spaghetti and meatballs. You can rarely go wrong with that." She pushes the mentioned orbs of flesh around in a pan.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Oh, alright. I could probably meet up with her in a second. For now, how are you feeling? I think you're doing an amazing job with the spaghetti, based on what I smell here yeah, so I hope you enjoy it too later. Thank you for your work in general, too. I just think you're pretty cool, like I've told you before. It's got to be your orange hair or chill attitude or something." She puts her elbows on the counter, and she watches Nina. "I could help with something if you like. Did you have a good olive oil out yet?"
		</div><div class="wrap Nina_w"><p>
		Shape gets a rather intrigued look from this array of questions. "Good cooking is a necessary skill to a proper personal assistant. I've taken good care to expand my skillset so a household like this can stay upright on just my efforts instead of requiring several staff and being horridly expensive as a result. Silver is quite orderly and not too invested in having many possessions so she's certainly one of the easier people I've worked for, which gives me time to put attention to detail." She sighs deeply, at the mention of orange hair and chill nature together. "I do try my best to have a smooth resolve. It's a bit of a chore to maintain that nature but it just feels right to me, even through the occasional pains... To your left, top shelf second from the left. Olive oil."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape smiles at Nina and she leans awkwardly forwardly and snatches the olive oil from the shelf. She places it beside the stove, which includes the pot with pasta noodles and the pot with sizzling sauce. "I'd love to learn to cook a bit better sometime. I've been around in this world for quite some time and have only managed to make some pretty basic stuff in general; I think pasta is one of the only reasonably complex things I can make consistently well. Bit of a shame. But, yeah, I think Silver is very orderly too. I even find her awfully pretty. Not a bad job at all..." She laughs, and then nods. "I'm sorry you sometimes have the pains, yeah. Hmm. You know, it'll happen to any of us, pains. I may look competent, but it's really just a façade at any given moment, it's not necessarily an accurate reflection of how I really feel."
		</div><div class="wrap Nina_w"><p>
		A wave of heat passes through Shape, rather uncomfortable but not quite enough to be painful. "Have you ever felt what it's like to be burning on the inside? I do, regularly. I didn't mean it in a figurative manner; it besets me with a searing ache to keep up my 'cool' nature for too long against the will of my powers. This isn't your everyday blues, but I have chosen to endure it." She's radiating more of a heat herself now, and she pinches the bridge of her nose in annoyance. "I really need to keep an eye on this food, try not to push an outburst right now. I'm already feeling quite touchy on these subjects."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape takes a few steps backwards from the maid and her cooking. She rubs the back of her neck, cleaning sweat beading down. "Hey... I'm sorry, genuinely. I didn't know it was... Yeah." So perhaps this is along the lines of what Silver meant by Nina having to expel her 'excessive energies.' She sighs, and shrugs. "I misunderstood, is what I mean. That's definitely a different can of worms than anything I've had. If there's anything I can do, you know, just know I'm happy to chat about anything and, yeah, I'll keep things on the down low. I'm not really as pompous as you might initially believe."
		</div><div class="wrap Nina_w"><p>
		There's a long sigh, and the air around Nina's mouth seems to waver slightly with ripples of heat. "Food should be done fairly soon - You could choose to notify Silver about it. Upstairs, first room to the right. You'll want to knock and be asked in; she does not like unannounced visits in her office at all." She takes three rather pricey looking bowls out of a cupboard and starts pouring off the water for the spaghetti.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape gazes to the stairwell that's barely visible from this angle of the dining area, and she glances sometimes back at Nina. She rubs her hands together and says, "Alright, I'll let Silver know then. I really appreciate the directions, and the meal, I'm pretty lost here. Sorry again...” She walks up the stairwell, sighing to herself, and she triple knocks on the door of Silver's office. "Hey. Food will be ready soon... May I come inside?" Shape wondered what all these rooms in the hallway would be for. How many of them are even regularly used.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"One moment, Shape." There's some slightly loud rustling of papers and folders. "Please, do come in." 
		<p>
		The office is fairly large and there's a pair of heavy metal drawers with several locks on them along the wall behind her desk. She seems to be very defensive about the contents. "Good to see you awake again, apologies for leaving you but I am a very busy lady after all. You looked comfortable enough without me. I could do with some food and anticipated you would too, so feel free to join us - Oh, I take it you talked to Nina already since you've come to tell me, so she probably already told you can join. Silly of me." She brushes together a few papers on her desk and picks up a pair of keys from her drawer. Probably for this room. "How did you rest?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Cool, sure." Shape looks at the office's less clinical elements, namely the very same painting that Silver bought the day of the festival. She admires where it sits on nails. Yet she still thinks about how she upset Nina, a distracting thought while she speaks. "I don't mind that you had stuff to do, I understand, yeah. But, well, I'm glad we can hang out again for dinner especially, I really have been enjoying our time..." She faces Silver, but her eyes are lowered sometimes. "I rested pretty good. I really like this manor, it's very comfortable, you know. Sure, it's not quaint, but it's got the same comfort as my place, maybe."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver gets up, and quite distinctly shoos Shape out of the room ahead of her, locking the door after leaving as well. "I'm glad you find it comfortable, I quite enjoy it as well. Sometimes I have to make do with the first thing that's available, though of course I have at least the luxury, privilege even of settling for something too big and expensive for my preferences." The dining table in the living room is startlingly ready for dinner considering how briefly Shape was upstairs, and Nina indicates a chair for the guest. It's a table that reasonably seats six; Silver has one end while Nina has the other, and Shape is placed to the right of Silver.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape takes a seat at the designated guest chair, then, and she twirls her fork into the red sauce spaghetti. Certainly not a store, box brand of the sauce or probably noodles, either. At least the sauce is clearly homemade. She takes a nibble and says, "Wow, this is really good. Thank you, Nina. It's exceptional." And she quietly slashes away at her portion of the pot at her plate. She sips the choice of water today.
		<p>
		Later, she says, "Your earlier thing you said, Silver, kind of reminded me of this one time I spent a few weeks with some friends over at some house in the woods. It was a very long time ago. They were complaining the house was too small when it had like eight bedrooms or something, so I guess it was sort of like the opposite problem. But yeah. Sometimes I think about my old friends like that." 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Nina accepts the compliments but stays quiet, probably a habit of being a servant at the dinner table. Not often do they partake in conversation then, after all. "Oh, curious. When you say some friends, how many are we talking of eight bedrooms isn't enough? And what does such a large group of people even do in the woods?" Silver chews on a meatball. "You make me curious, you seem to have met and engaged with so many intriguing souls throughout your time. Maybe I have a small bit of envy, even. Were these many people nice?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape's managed to smear her glasses with a speck of sauce. She simply removes them. "Well, that's the thing, there was like maybe 7 of us, we just had people over a lot too and, well, the owner of the woodland place was kind of picky about always making sure there was room and avoiding 'sleep overs'... They were all basically from the same faraway place, I don't really remember what it was called, and really the only reason I got to be friends with them was some misunderstanding an even longer time ago that kind of put me smack dab in their friend group. But it was kinda forgiven by this point and I just ended up being a lasting presence with them, you know?"
		<p>
		She places her fork down. "Well, it's sort of over now. I only really know where one of them is now from that group. And I've met a lot of people, sure, but it's been ages from most of them. Don't envy me... They were very nice though, yeah." She puffs her cheek.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver chuckles after swallowing down a mouthful of noodle. "That misunderstanding doesn't involve shapeshifty mishaps, does it? Sounds like some truly awkward things can happen being the wrong person at the wrong time. I have seen an occasional movie on things like that, body swaps and the like." She carefully wipes a spot of red sauce off the table and Nina gives it a slightly longer look. It'll have to be properly washed off anyhow so honestly it's easier to attend to when you can still see the spots. But she doesn't complain. 
		<p>
		"You've got a dignified youth to you so I have to admit it often falls hard on me to realize you're... Probably well older than me? I forget if you mentioned anything of the sorts. Who is this one person? Anything exciting?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		She struggles to conceal a grin. "Yeah... It did, actually. But it's not always because of that, you know, it just happens to be this time." She lifts her fork again for more, and then continues. "Oh, I have so many opinions on body swap media and ones with shapeshifters, you have no idea. Don't even get me started. Another time. But yeah. I am old. I guess it's only fair I tell you that I'm fifty. I'm really cheating death, I guess." She examines Nina and Silver's eyes, and shuffles back in her chair. "She's called Jae-eun. She's dreadful. She hates me. Has eight tails. Is half fox. Last I heard she's got into the lousy business of potions."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver does give an eyebrow raise at the age, and she smiles. "You both make me feel young and old at the same time, honestly. Between actual age and our comparative looks. Soon, you might start yelling at kids to get off your lawn." She pushes her plate slightly aside, and meets eyes with Nina in confirmation. Shape gets a similar look, asking if she's done with food.
		<p>
		The idea of 'lousy' potions does quite strike Silver, and she can't resist prying. "Potions, you say? You hear so much about them in fantasy but they're so incredibly all over the place and vaguely described. I'd be highly curious to see what an actual real life equivalent of that would look like. If it's hazardous gloop or divine elixir in truth." 
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Mm, please don't say that." She sighs, tilting her clean plate forward to Nina. She pushes away the age stuff from mind. "Potions? Oh, yeah. Potions. They're definitely more of column a than column b, like basically liquids by nature are much more volatile than say the rune stones. You're not going to get much out of them in the real world, no. In fact, uh, they were always more of a drinking game than a tool." She's not willing to be made fun of, too, for forgetting her original name through one.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"And people can make a business off that, still? Surely there must be more to it. I'd like to go, sometime. If just to sate my curiosity." Having already been distinctly derailed from the uncomfortable age statements, she sees it unfitting to rewind for the sake of an apology. Nina takes all three plates and vanishes off to the kitchen to do the cleanup. "Would you take me there? Or at least help me find the way. Please?"
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Sure, in the same way you can make a business selling snake oil." She slumps now, and she says, "You can't be serious. I really don't want to talk to Jae-eun anytime soon, and it just isn't worth the hype even if I can locate a different potion vendor..." She blinks slowly, and she rubs her temple. "But I know you don't like no for an answer, and I don't want you getting yourself in trouble going by yourself. So how about we reach a compromise, and you give me something in return that's a bit out of the way? It's going to have to be good..."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"You speak my language, Shape. If you need some money to throw at a problem to make it stop, or have people that need an, ahem, talking to? I could surely arrange such. But even other, less direct matters I'd be willing to participate in." There's a glint in her eyes, one that the sense of a good business deal would provoke in such a person as Silver. She might be softening up under the presence of Shape, but. She's been part of business for many years. It sticks with you, at that point.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Eh, I just needed the bit of money you were already agreeing to offering me, which I'm very grateful for I'd like to say again, and I don't need to have you affect anyone like that, no." She's rubs her temple some more, and she stands up from the dining room table with her glass of water. "I think instead... Ah, how about this for an idea. But first-- does anybody help you fashion your outfits, or do you just kinda do that all yourself, putting the pieces together and putting it on I mean?"
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		A puzzling request, and Silver really can't tell where this could possibly be going. "Um... I have taken some pointers from people in the business in the past, but by now it's largely habitual. I can find the pieces I need, have them tailored for me as needed, and I tend to not be too diverse in my looks - Oh, thank you, Nina." A second plate appears for both of them, a reasonably sized serving of tiramisu for each with some strawberries on the side.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Oh, that's kinda neat. So you'd say you've definitely got quite the talent for assembling outfits from different tailors and such, at least for yourself,  yeah. Well... I humbly request, if you want us to meet Jae-eun and her potions and have me fake a smile about it, you become my personal-- uh, whatever the term is for people whose job is to help people design or advise the outfits that suit them? I have all this power to change my body and adopt clothes, and yet I feel you have a much, much better sense of fashion. I tried to look elegant today, but even then... I feel I always end up just a bit amateur."
		<p>
		Shape takes a greedy chunk of her tiramisu, and smiles at Nina.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"That is... Quite vague, I must admit. The logistics of that are complicated to say the very least, since you can create the clothes but need my advice and adjustments. We could manage, but it'd be an effort depending on how easily you can visualize my input. Anyhow... As I said, just being that is a very vague request. Would I advise an outfit and you just do your best to memorize it for later? Several? Would this be for any specific events, or over a period of time? Would it be for special cases or just an everyday task for me?" 
		<p>
		Silver takes a moment to realize how much she's rambling about this request, and pauses. "...You get my point, hopefully. I need concrete details to judge such a thing."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"God, you sound like Vera," Shape muses to them. "Alright, look, I just think it'd be kinda fun if... it was for a number of special occasions where I request your assistance. Let's say 20 times. And, sure, there'd be a more mild form of it on normal days where I just wear some particular outfits by your suggestion that aren't necessarily in that special list of 20 special outfits... Like a rotation of 'normal, but Silver recommended' outfits I'd maintain for normal daily use. It's going to take ages to find Jae-eun, and learn about her potions and show them off later maybe, and recover from having to pretend to care about her, so." Shape cuts a strawberry in half on her plate.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		Silver scoffs a fair bit at the comparison, but decides that elaborating is a bad idea. "When you said you wanted something in return, I expected something a bit more reasonable than a month's worth of work. You do know people get educations in looking good? It's an art, a science, and I think you're undervaluing how much time and effort actually goes into it. I hope not on purpose." Silver takes a moment to pry at the dessert, taking a few forkfuls. Deliberately not giving a counteroffer. Shape has to earn that, still.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"It's less about undervaluing it and more about wanting an excuse to do neat new things with you, if I'm being honest. It's not like I'd ignore you or discredit you, I'd be super grateful and excited, yknow?" Shape joins Silver on eating tiramisu for a while, and then says, "Twelve. Twelve special occasion outfits and the additional daily outfits. I'd love to see you prove your work is more than black on white." 
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"Don't forget the silver accents. They're very important." Silver rubs her temple slightly, fearing her business sense is making it hard to evaluate this in a 'friend' way. "I do suppose it would be a fun exercise anyhow. I can settle on ten, take it before I have second thoughts." Being offered twelve and countering with ten is purely a bargain trap, she's sure of that, but she just doesn't want this to continue and people to get more upset than they need to be.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape's eyes widen, briefly, and she reaches across the dining table to shake Silver's hand. "Then it's a deal. Deal done. I won't ever forget about those silver accents, no no no. Oh, and it would be very fun, I'll make sure of it. Thank you so much!" She smiles again, both genuinely and with the vague flavor of cars sales representative. She hums, "I'm glad we were able to work something out for both of our reasons, Silver."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"So, Shape dear, when do you think we'll be able to go there? I really do think 'as soon as possible' is my preferred time, though not today. The curiosity and lack of knowledge will hound my memory until then." The deal has been made, and now Silver should just make the best of the outcome rather than lament it being a rushed one. She slowly finishes her dessert, and her glass of water. "I might have not planned in a movie and dinner with guests today so I am afraid my goals for the rest of the day are turning a bit cramped."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		Shape says, "Alright, yeah, tell you what-- since I pity you having to wonder about these potions all on your own, or at least the thought of it, and I have nothing going on lately, let's do it tomorrow. Unless you got any plans then? Just, yeah, let's make time first tomorrow at your or my place for maybe like my first 'daily outfit,' like a non-special occasion one if you remember... Would you prefer to drive or should I, after that?" She picks the last of her dessert as well, and she sighs. "Yeah, I guess I'll get going, I definitely bothered you long enough today. It was a lot of fun, though. Tomorrow will be besides Jae-eun..."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"That being said though, it's been enjoyable having you around. Well done. And tomorrow does sound good; I'll stop by your house. I should take a look at what you usually wear to somewhat accommodate your comforts and habits after all. Do have some thought as to, well... How you'd want to present towards a potion shop, and Jae-eun. Casual or comfortable, colors, the likes. And speaking of. How much emphasis can go into making your personal look? I never asked. How trivial or effort is it to make changes, how much can we tweak and play with it along with the outfit. Or even just the effort of making a new outfit in the first place. Ah, there's so many things to keep in mind."
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Oh, fun, I'll show you my closet. You'll probably think I dress like a cartoon character, I happen to have the same beige V-neck like ten times just because I keep generating new copies of it and then not throwing it away. But there's other stuff too, yeah. I'll show you it. And, yeah, that's a good idea, I'll think about how I want to look to her." She takes her glass of water and walks beside the dinner table but not leaving the room. "Oh, thankfully, it's not nearly as exhausting as using my abilities to change my whole body. I can change my body like three times a day max; I can change my clothes with magic maybe like fifteen times a day."
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"That's is somewhat limiting, hmm, but not overly. So I'll have to adapt the outfit to your looks, and we can't be extremely fussy on the details all the way through. Rather clean up after we have a base idea... Ah, I'll be thinking about this all evening. I should try to get some work done alongside it. Let me show you out, and I look forward to tomorrow." She stands up as well, and stretches just subtly.
		</div><div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
		"Eh, it's sort of like 20 Questions, if you ever played that. I think we can nail the look in that amount, probably way less. If we have to do a couple days of attempts for it sometimes though, that's fine," She says. The tall ShapeShifter walks ahead to the front entrance with her phone, purse, and shoes. "I look forward to it too. I really appreciate you thinking about it even this evening, that's honestly like-- incredibly kind of you. I'll be calling you my stylist, Silver." She saunters out into the cold night.
		</div><div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		"I am familiar with the concept, at least. Educated guesses and efficiently narrowing things down." Silver waves off Shape, and once the door is closed, she grumbles slightly. "Several days for an outfit. Calling me a stylist. Why do I like this person?" But then she smiles, thinking back at the evening. Maybe she's somewhat okay after all.
