		<h1>About Jainachrome.de</h1>
		<p>
			This website is primarily intended to host and to provide context for casual, literate roleplay writing Jaina and the system of Monochrome. However, other personal writings and content may be posted.
		<p>
			We considered the possibility of editing the literate roleplay stories into a novelization with one consistent authoring voice and structure. This would come at the benefit of being a more familiar, and therefore accepted, product. We decided against this for several reasons, though.
		<p>
			For one, it would likely undermine the nuances of the work of the participants. Those involved are diverse and each has a unique tone and set of mannerisms. Novelizing the roleplay writings would be ironing these creases, intentionally or unintentionally.
		<p>
			For two, literate co-authoring is a legitimate form of storytelling. We don’t want to undermine its value in anyone’s work, so we’d rather demonstrate it largely as is and with only minor revision as desired. The often dual nature of the pacing and the authoring will remain. We hope to inspire other role-players to share their passion projects.
		<p>
			And three, perhaps most importantly, rewriting lengthy scrawls of roleplay would likely suck the fun and anticipation for the craft from us.
		<p>			
			Of course, this could change. Maybe someday, on a select story, one of us would write a second draft.
