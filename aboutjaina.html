		<h1>About Jaina</h1>
		<div class="wrap Jaina_w"><p>
			I’m a transgender, pansexual woman (she/her) living in Washington, USA intending to move to Norway by the start of 2024. I’m polyamorous and could accept many partners, yet the lovers of my life, the system of Monochrome, are the constants on my horizon.
		<p>
			I write casual, literate roleplay with primarily Monochrome. I stream video games on Discord voice calls with online friends and talk about anything. I watch YouTube videos and the very occasional movie or show. I play Sudoku on Logic Master’s Germany and hardly dent the four and five star puzzles. I rarely program a tool to play the said Sudoku.
		<p>
			I give people burgers in bags and drinks on carriers.
		<p>
			I grew up in Wyoming and Florida, keeping a tight-knit community of friends at every pastime at every age. My time spent with others often consisted of a harmless walk outside that evolved into playful chaos.
		<p>
			I attended community college and then university gender-questioning. I dropped out of a pure mathematics major in 2020 because of the Corona pandemic compounding mental health deterioration that the academic environment itself already onset. With the era of empty schedules and clarity this ushered, I formally began my medical and social transition into a woman. I also worked as a Panera baker. Later in 2021, I joined my longtime friend on Discord in a co-lease in Washington.
