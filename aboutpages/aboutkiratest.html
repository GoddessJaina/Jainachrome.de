        An about page for Kira? Peculiar choice.<br />
        Observe the Observer, that does not make sense.<br />
        Alas, this website requires its voice.<br />
        Therefore, one may partake in Kira's two cents.<br />
      </p>

        <span class="spoiler">
          Kira is an entity of unknowable qualities. It prefers to observe, to not participate, to take more than it
          gives in presence. It is one of the few nonverbal forms of Monochrome as a result. <br />
          It has a strong sense of selectiveness in what information it gives out as a result. Writing in poems
          harnesses a creative strain of Monochrome that foes woefully underused at times, and adds a lot of deliberate
          choice to words and meaning. More casual, freeform text that Kira posts ends up spoilered or otherwise
          partially concealed. Test.
