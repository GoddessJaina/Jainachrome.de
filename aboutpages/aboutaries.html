	<div class="wrap Anya_w">
		<p>
			I'm Aries! Or Anya. I am a pink bigender fairy of boy and girl (She/her and he/him). I can be very playful,
			affectionate, a bit erratic and easily amused. Despite our physical shortcomings I can be rather energetic,
			and more prone to tiring myself out as a result. Unlike the rest of Monochrome I am quite a small creature -
			my headspace self varies between a 1'8 and 4'7 height, the former much more often with wings than the
			latter. My gender can fluctuate a fair amount, and so does my appearance - I can truly be quite shapeshifty
			in nature should I find a fun reason to, much more so than other Monochromes.
