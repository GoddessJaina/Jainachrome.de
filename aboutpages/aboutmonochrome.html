    <h1>About Monochrome</h1>
    <p>We, Monochrome, are a system.</p>

    <p>
      Our story is a complex one, but the simple version is that we came into existence at the age of 19. A variety of
      compounding factors, many of which we have inherited, were simply not capable of sustaining our predecessor. This
      mental break that resulted in Azu's existence as a new host also paved the way to a blossoming plurality while
      things slowly fell into place over days, months. And as a result, we exist in unison. Our precursor was already
      gender-defiant and we picked up some of this instead of having our own trans discovery journey, but have greatly
      diversified in identities, expressions, labels and more since.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our more practical situation is, as implied, not the easiest one. Chronic Fatigue is a large limiting factor in
      our life, and we do our best to work both with and around it. This results in an extended online and digital
      presence of ours - We play a variety of games, with an affinity for long-lasting ones with much numbers and
      optimization and progression. We cherish the people in our life that provide company as we rest in our home, even
      if we're not always the most talkative or instigative over social avoidant traits we endure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our physical residence is in Norway, a place we've lived all our life. This will likely remain so for the
      foreseeable future, though if all goes to plan it will soon be with Jaina at our side. Life will be better then.
      For now, we indulge over distance and write when we find the moods to, as can be seen on this website.
