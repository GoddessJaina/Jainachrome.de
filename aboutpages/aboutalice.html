	<h1>About Alice</h1>
	<p>
		Alice, or 'Alis, short for Glacialis, is the encompassing name for a cat with three Facets. Aurora, Athame and
		Aeon. Existing on a scale of presentation, these facets primarily embody light, mist and shadow along with a
		strong affinity for ice and snow. Several other traits fluctuate along this scale - as a whole, Alice is
		genderfluid demigirl/agender, and uses e/eir pronouns (pronounced e as in bee, and eir like ear.) Each facet
		also uses a different secondary set of pronouns too. E is asexual as a contrast to the majority of Monochrome.
	<p>
		Eir favorite place on earth is Iceland, especially Reynisfjara, the black sand beach.

		<p>
			About Aurora
		<p>
			I am the lightcat. You may call me Aurora, Day or Nadia, and use she/her as an alternative to e/eir. I am
			the most forward and politely social of the cats, and do try to be helpful when I can. I have my soft spots
			and can at times have my catty needs for affection.

	<div class="wrap Athame_w">
		<p>
			About Athame
		<p>
			I am the intermediate state of cat, in many senses. I go by the first names Athame, Dawn or Ashley (Ash). My
			auxiliary pronouns are they/them. As given by my primary name, I do quite like knives and sharp things. I am
			the more feisty of the three cats and enjoy sociality but can show more Aeon-like aversive leanings at
			times, especially when bothered somehow.
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="wrap Aeon_w">
		<p>
			About Aeon
		<p>
			I am the shadowy flavor of cat. I go by the first names Aeon, Dusk, and Ace, and use auxiliary it/its
			pronouns. My primary sense of self revolves around serenity and solitude. I will gladly take time to myself
			over situations that don't appeal to me, and have a generally quiet nature. I can still succeed in a quiet
			comfort around people.
