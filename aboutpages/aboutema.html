      <p>
        I am a woman of many names, but you may call me Ema. Short for my primary last name, Hematite. In actuality, my
        primary first name is Azu as well - There was initially only one Azu but at the painstaking crossroads of trying
        to choose between feminine non-binary and being a woman, the choice was made to simply walk both paths. We've
        diverged a fair amount since then but have a lot of underlying things more in common than the other Monochromes
        as a result of this.
      </p>

      <p>
        My fronting is usually rare and shorter than most others', as I have found myself in the unfortunate position to
        have my presence be much more draining than usual and my reserves more limited. I do make most of my time
        though, when I can. I do have a fondness for people who appreciate me and are kind, but likewise I can be very
        dismissive and blunt against people who have proven themselves to deserve it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a fascination for blood and anatomy, and my leanings can be of a more proper and regal manner. In my
        alter presentation I tend to be just an inch shorter than Azu, but compensate for it with more heels and the
        like. I have a tendency to vary my hair in a longer fashion, and carry reds rather than silvers along with the
        Azu white.
