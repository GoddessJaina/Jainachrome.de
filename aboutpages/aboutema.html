		<h1>About Ema</h1>
		<div class="wrap Ema_w"><p>
		I am a woman of many names, but you may call me Ema. Short for my primary last name, Hematite. In actuality, my primary first name is Azu as well - There was initially only one Azu but at the painstaking crossroads of trying to choose between feminine non-binary and being a woman, the choice was made to simply walk both paths. We've diverged a fair amount since then but have a lot of underlying things more in common than the other Monochromes as a result of this. 
		<p>
		My fronting is usually rare and shorter than most others', as I have found myself in the unfortunate position to have my presence be much more draining than usual and my reserves more limited. I do make most of my time though, when I can. I do have a fondness for people who appreciate me and are kind, but likewise I can be very dismissive and blunt against people who have proven themselves to deserve it. 
		<p>
		I have a fascination for blood and anatomy, and my leanings can be of a more proper and regal manner. In my alter presentation I tend to be just an inch shorter than Azu, but compensate for it with more heels and the like. I have a tendency to vary my hair in a longer fashion, and carry reds rather than silvers along with the Azu white.
