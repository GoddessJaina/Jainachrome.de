		<h1>About Azu</h1>
		<div class="wrap Azu_w"><p>
		I am Azu. Or Sera, Serafina, if you will. I am the host of this band of misfits. My gender is not well specified, but I consider myself feminine nonbinary, or a femby if you will. They/them pronouns. I am not human, and enjoy this fact - The circumstances of my existence are not at all adjacent to how humans are created. I see myself in a humanoid form in headspace largely for ease of sensory relation but I can certainly toy with features to indulge myself. I tend to regard myself quite highly and a good way to my heart is appeasing this. I am not an inherently good being, but I find kindness practical and do consider people's opinions of me as valuable. I will offer and indulge softer tones with the right people though, especially when the fatigues hit or I am otherwise tired. Being intimidating and evil is hard work~ 
		<p>
		I see myself in a slowly diversifying pool of elements - Silver, Angelic, Toxic, Sweet, Binary, Arachnid, and more. I have a color spectrum a bit wider than some of the others - Primarily blacks and whites, not much gray. Accented by slight carnelian red sometimes. Other times, greens sate my joy for toxins and acids and other harmful substances. Or, I might indulge in the Raspberry Peach hues.
