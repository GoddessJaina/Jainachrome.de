	<h1>About Jaina</h1>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			I’m a transgender, pansexual woman (she/her) living in Washington, USA intending to move to Norway soon. I’m
			polyamorous and could accept many partners, yet the lovers of my life, the system of Monochrome and the
			silly femboy Audrey, are the constants on my horizon.
		<p>
			I write casual, literate roleplay. I stream video games on Discord voice calls with online girlfriends and
			talk about anything. I watch YouTube videos and the very occasional movie or show. I play Sudoku on Logic
			Master’s Germany and dent some of the five-star puzzles. I program some projects including a visual novel. I
			also read.
		<p>
			I grew up in Wyoming and Florida, keeping a tight-knit community of friends at every pastime at every age.
			My time spent with others often consisted of a harmless walk outside that evolved into playful chaos.
		<p>
			I attended community college and then university gender-questioning. I dropped out of a pure mathematics
			major in 2020 because of the Corona pandemic compounding mental health deterioration that the academic
			environment itself already onset. With the era of empty schedules and clarity this ushered, I formally began
			my medical and social transition into a woman. Later in 2021, I joined my longtime friend on Discord in a
			co-lease in Washington. Then, I joined Audrey in a different co-lease in Washington.
