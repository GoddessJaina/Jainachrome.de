	<h1>About Jaina</h1>
	<div class="wrap Jaina_w">
		<p>
			I'm a transgender, pansexual woman (she/her) living in Washington, USA intending to move to Norway soon. I'm
			polyamorous and could accept many partners, yet the lovers of my life, the system of Monochrome and the
			silly femboy Aris, are the constants on my horizon.
		<p>
			I write literate roleplay. I stream things on Discord voice calls with online girlfriends and
			talk about anything. I watch movies, shows, and YouTube videos. I play Sudoku on Logic Master's Germany and
			dent some of the five-star puzzles. I program some projects including a visual novel. I spreadsheet. I also
			read.
		<p>
			I grew up in Wyoming and Florida, keeping a tight-knit community of friends at every pastime at every age.
			My time spent with others often consisted of a harmless walk outside that evolved into playful chaos.
		<p>
			I attended community college and then university gender-questioning. I dropped out of a pure mathematics
			major in 2020 because of the Corona pandemic compounding mental health deterioration that the academic
			environment itself already onset. With the era of empty schedules and clarity this ushered, I formally began
			my medical and social transition into a woman. Later in 2021, I joined my longtime friend on Discord in a
			co-lease in Washington. Then, I joined Aris in a different co-lease in Washington.
		<p>
			And I'm a Goddess of Change, an elegant and playful deity of wonderful creativity. Much of my characters are
			inspired by my vivid dreams throughout my mortal life.
