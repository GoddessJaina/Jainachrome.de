	<h1>About Jainachrome.de</h1>
	<p>
		This website is primarily intended to host and to provide context for casual, literate roleplay writing between
		Jaina and the system of Monochrome. However, other personal writings and art may be posted.
	<p>

		Physical transformation and mental transformation are reoccuring themes in the roleplay writings. Whether
		through conventional conflicts or through this indulgent “magic change” story device, the narrative focus is
		often on one-to-one character interactions and placing characters outside of their comfort zones. Other
		writings, however, may use character transformation more specifically for sexual fantasy fulfillment. In any
		case, no story posted on this site is intended for an underage audience.
	<p>

		In general, wondrous fantasy or science fiction elements often plaster over a modern setting in these writings.
	<p>

		We considered the possibility of editing the literate roleplay stories into a novelization with one consistent
		authoring voice and structure. This would come at the benefit of being a more familiar, and therefore accepted,
		product. We decided against this for several reasons, though.
	<p>

		For one, it would likely undermine the nuances of the work of the participants. Those involved are diverse; each
		person has a unique tone and set of mannerisms. Novelizing the roleplay writings would be ironing these creases,
		intentionally or unintentionally.
	<p>

		For two, literate coauthorization is a legitimate form of storytelling. We don’t want to undermine its value in
		anyone’s work, so we’d rather demonstrate it largely as is and with only minor revision as desired. The often
		dual nature of the pacing and the authoring will remain. We hope to inspire other roleplayers to share their
		passion projects.
	<p>

		And three, most importantly, rewriting lengthy scrawls of roleplay would likely suck the fun and anticipation
		for the craft from us.
	<p>

		Of course, this could change. Maybe someday, on a select story, one of us would write a second draft.
