		<p>
			I am, in simple terms, the caretaker of the system. Agender, Ace, Aromantic, a being of darkness.
			Ix/ix'/ixself â€“ Rhymes with 'hiss'. I am always to some extent present, but largely sit back to observe and
			be prepared for when direct action is needed. In the past, my direct fronting presence usually came in
			response to serious events that needed attending to, but I have grown more willing to simply present for the
			occasional days. Largely, needing a small shift in fronting schedule is our excuse to spare such days.
		<p>
			If you wrong the system, you wrong me. Our patience is strong and we are very forgiving but there is a limit
			to what we will put up with. If worse comes to worse, my allegiance is exclusively with Monochrome, and I
			will defend it to the bitter end. Defy my insistence at the worst of times and you risk making a fearsome
			enemy.
