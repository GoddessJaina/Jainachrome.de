Shape walks into the deciduous forest wrapped in a brown wool coat with a hoodie.  Twigs crack and dry soil shifts under his feet, and the afternoon sun is lost from the thin tree canopy. He rubs his mittens together and then trots on, his freezing heart beating faster. He or she should be close enough now to see him and help him remove this gray hex imbued by that backstabber. She had to help him-- fairies in general didn't just let people die, did they? Not from something so slow to be lethal at least. They're usually tricky and impatient about these things, from what he's seen, and not often murderers anyway. Shape shivers, buckling onto a thick layer of vibrant grass. He calls out, “Anya? I heard about y-you.” He then covers his lips with his coat. 
Anya — 06/15/2021
There is no response at first, but soon after in the shaded lighting appears a gently glowing speck of light some distance away. It drifts in wave motions, slowly approaching the poor little fellow and finally lingering just a few feet away. It sits there, quietly. Waiting.
Jaina — 06/15/2021
His lips are shown again, and he exhales an icy mist. “Thank G-Gods for being here. Anya I've been.. Cursed to be really cold. I can show you the hex marking-- it's on my wrist.” He rolls down the sleeve of the coat partway and turns his wrist to the speck of light. The gray marking resembles a lattice of six icicles, and the color sinks deep into the skin and nerves. “Please, Anya, fair-- fairy of these woods.” He knows this can't be enough, but he should be able to convince her.
Anya — 06/15/2021
The little glowing orb drifts away barely halfway through the riveting elaboration as it it had no interest at all, floating upwards towards a nearby tree. Past it, from Shape's view, is a suspiciously dense cluster of branches. Not something one would take note of if not deliberately looking up - and as the glow passes through a clear, rectangular opening, it's clear there's a small house in the crown of the tree. The gentle glow illuminates an open doorframe and a small window beside it. 

A small voice pipes up, sounding somewhat unawake and disgruntled. 
"Who's you? What do you want? I was in the middle of a nap so this better be important."
(I'm sorry, Shape. You'll have to make your pleas a second time x.x)
Jaina — 06/15/2021
(Haha.)
Shape bites his lip and looks behind him, as if hoping someone else would pipe in. “Well I just explained during it but to recap--” He faces the little opening of the house. “Anya, fair fairy of the woods, I've been hexed by a bad sorceress. I grow colder and colder, like in the literal sense, as in I'm freezing slowly inside and I really need your help. I learned of you before and-- well, I'd be eternally grateful for your assistance.” He huddles into a fetal position.
Anya — 06/15/2021
Out from the slight overhang outside the house peeks a small face with pink hair falling down around it. Anya tilts her head aside, observing. "I was going to say that I've heard way better stories for the purpose of getting it on with a fairy, but that actually looks bad. You didn't answer the 'who's you' part, though. I can't legally bind you to my totally not suspicious magical trickeries if I don't know that." She giggles. "Also it's just polite."
Jaina — 06/15/2021
Shape nods and rubs his knees together. “Right. Okay. Please just call me Shape... That is my name. I have magical tricks of my own, but they're not helpful here unfortunately.” He lifts his chin. “This isn't my first rodeo with a fairy, so... Is it all right if we keep the tricks until after-- this? I feel terrible, Anya.”
Anya — 06/15/2021
"Ooookiedokie! I'll be right down!" Anya stands up to the edge; he's now visible with a very light coverage of what seems like woven plant garments. A quick and elegant flip off the edge, she dives down towards the ground. Letting her wings catch the fall at the very end, he swoops forward and rolls into the grass next to Shape before fluttering back up above to get a good look. 

"So, Shape. What can you tell or show me? I need to know what I'm working with here and I'm not like those 'licensed doctors' who stick fancy gadgets in your face holes." He flutters about anyhow, looking for whatever she can.
Jaina — 06/15/2021
Anya is, to Shape, practically a fairy tale fairy. Living in what's essentially a bird house, covered in leaf, agile and beyond gender, Anya could easily be in a Disney Renaissance film. But appearances are only appearances. He smiles, through the cold teeth, and uncovers his wrist for him again. “I can't even remember the last time I did traditional medicine... Wait, nevermind, I had a Tylenol a couple weeks ago. But yeah, this marking must have did something to my sensory system...” He doesn't bother to follow Anya's erratic flight.
Anya — 06/15/2021
She doesn't hesitate to start inspecting the markings, waving her hands a few times to make magic sparkles and seeming more and more displeased with each cast. "You, uh... You got yourself into some real shit, didn't you? This is not your average corner store hex." He focuses and manifests a glow over the markings, but it is too rejected and only serves to cause a brief but terrible itch in the markings. "I'll need some time and also stuff to actually dispel this, but I should be able to mitigate some of it temporarily to start. You're going to owe me for this."
Jaina — 06/15/2021
“Yeah, I guess I did. It wasn't supposed to be like this, but somebody didn't want to play by the established...” He shivers. “It's okay, I'm really grateful you're here. Thank you again-- I'll definitely make it up to you, yeah, definitely since it's so serious and all.” Assuming, of course, the bargain was even reasonable, and the fairy continued to play nice. He scratches the temporary itch on the marking, but his mittens make it ineffective. “If there's anything I can do in the meantime to help, I'll try. Mm--” Shape winces and clutches over his heart.
Anya — 06/15/2021
Anya moves aside a bit, and there's a sudden bright flash of pink that envelops her location. As it fades again seconds later, there's now a small but distinctly human sized Anya in his place, sitting in the grass. He puts a hand to his chest, and carefully conjures out a radiant orb of light. Holding it out, the slightest semblance of warmth washes over the skin that's closest to the manifestation. 

"I'll let you borrow some of my warmth, for now. It should probably make you a little bit less miserable, though stoking it somehow would surely make it much stronger."  The orb sinks into Shape's chest, and it does indeed do a job of mitigating the deep-seated frost inside. 

Worth noting that in the shapeshift, the grassy attire has not persisted and Anya's only decency currently is waist length pink hair falling over his somewhat flat chest, and the tall grass coming high enough up the body to conceal her crossed legs.
Jaina — 06/15/2021
(uwu)
Jaina — 06/15/2021
A tear sheds from Shape's eye before the orb enters into his chest. It's a remarkable sensation-- Shape feels at about eighty percent, instead of ten. But, of course, it's tapered with concerns. He takes off his mittens and unbuttons his winter coat, revealing his casual red t-shirt. He even has some sweat glisten on his forehead from the sudden warmth of the winter coat before placing it aside. He runs his hand across his face and says, “Thank you, Anya. I feel guilty about borrowing your warmth as you say. I'd rather you stay warm too. But... This is really helpful, for now. Can I help in some way with the process of the cure?” He stares at the human-size Anya, glazing at his eyes and his vibrant hair down to her waist. “You do look pretty, I will mention. Is your hair always that color?”
Anya — 06/15/2021
She does not hesitate to drape Shape's coat loosely over her shoulders, giving off a slight shiver as he's now not entirely oblivious to somewhat mild air. "Aw, thank you. And yes, it's my favorite color. I've tried a lot of variations but I do always come back to this." The warmth in Shape's chest picks up, remarkably in pace with the ever so slight appreciative blush on Anya's face. It fades again, though, as soon as it came. This must be what he meant by 'stoking the warmth'. 

"You're quite precious too, you are. And I'm not just saying that because you're such a pitiful state right now. As for the hex... We'll need some concentrated soulfire, strong enough to melt the core of bitter cold seated inside you in one go. There's a good few steps to that. You said you have some assortment of magic yourself, what kinds? There's a good chance any of them might prove useful."

Jaina — 11/18/2021
Shape smiles, weakly, and touches the coat draping Anya now. The sudden warmth that flares up in the orb inside Shape is a nice coincidence to the fairy's moment... In any case, Shape just wants to stay close to Anya, and assist him closely. He tilts his head, and says, “I'm precious? That's very nice of you to say, really flattering. Yeah.. I think I'm a bit better usually, too. But yeah, 'concentrated soulfire,' sounds a bit elusive and maybe painful, but we'll do whatever it takes. My abilities.. Are a bit of a one-trick pony, and probably not very helpful here. I'd show you, but I think I'd pass out, maybe. I'm a shapeshifter, and I usually prefer to keep it in the realm of human vessels. What you see here is a common one of mine. I'm not sure many dedicated shapeshifters exist in this region, I've struggled to find more like me anyway. Usually it's just one thing of many in the toolkit of a greater magical presence.”
Anya — 11/18/2021
"It's actually not very painful at all. If you use it correctly, of course. It's like..." She pokes at the place the orb had entered his chest. "Like that, but more. Again! If you don't fuck it up and give your emotions third degree burns. It's really uncomfortable if you do that. You'd start having grating, itching sensations inside whenever you experience Feelings for the next while. So let's avoid that." He shuffles around a bit, to try and promote some more warmth. Couldn't this have happened in some manner of toasty summer day? Oh well, the fairy thinks. 

"Shapeshifting, huh? I... Don't think that's exactly what we need for this project unless there's a magical reagents store nearby you could impersonate the staff of. I need to revisit the exact details of some proper soulfire distillation, but I think we're in luck and we could find most of the ingredients in the general vicinity. I might have to recruit some friends for the purpose. You don't have any stockpiled magical thingymabobs to exploit, by chance?" She resists making a comment on being one of those people where shapeshifting is just a part of his assortment of magical fairy skills.
Jaina — 11/18/2021
“Oh, what a relief. Well, I much prefer having those emotional burns compared to having died, so it's definitely something I'm happy to risk.” Shape furrows his eyes as Anya keeps adjusting in the coat, and he puts his hand under the coat when there's an opening, rubbing her shoulder in an apologetic gesture. “I was thinking, maybe if you're really cold now we could also grab some more blankets during this process? Do I feel warmer to you now too, maybe that'd help?” He sits pretty much at Anya's side, towering a bit over him, and then he says, “If that store exists, I honestly might be all right with just buying it unless it's really expensive. Recruiting your friends sounds good, though, yeah. I think we'll probably need help. All my stockpiled magical things are not here, they're back home, which is like several miles out, we'd have to get my car which is like.. Kinda far from here too. Mild potions and my runestones probably aren't what you need, though?” He considers if he's even in a state to drive, or get to the car. 
Anya — 11/18/2021
Anya sighs softly and leans into the touch, seeming very little objecting to having her bare skin touched by a complete stranger like this. The hand is a tad chilly but it's the gesture is warmer than the magic is cold. He leans in slightly, and seems... Again, slightly more warm to Shape's chest. "Well, it is quite unfortunate that you decided to show up in the afternoon. Considering, well. I have a small fairy home for small fairies, and while I could offer a blanket or two, they're kind of." He makes a gesture with his hands that indicates a square too small to cover a person. "Did you plan to like. Just get poofed back into okayness? That seems a bit well optimistic an outcome, to me."

It is, in fact, slowly getting a bit more shady and it's a question of time before the cool night will start settling in. Considering the two are already clawing at a limited reserve, that's less than ideal. It seems just a bit more sizeable though, as the fairy cuddles gently into their side.
Jaina — 11/18/2021
As Shape's chest warms again in a disjoint way once more, he takes his free hand to feel it through his shirt. And, with his other hand, he touches and teases her neck and upper back as well, feeling the orb's radiant heat adapt in real time. He gets close enough with the fairy that he's partially inside the coat as well, granted only part of his side. “Yeah... I didn't really want to come here in the afternoon, or actually at all, I merely had to because I was dying and I knew that a fairy of these woods could help. You are very generous though, and again, pretty.” He smirks and looks away for a moment. “I have to be optimistic. Well.. If the house is too small, and it's becoming dark, I think we should go to my car. I promise it'll be comfortable for a woodland presence like you. There's like a scented tree in it. Heating as well. Then we can figure out what to do.” The sky's color, too, is colder, and receding into an early sunset.
Anya — 11/18/2021
All the caressing, and the gentle compliments, make the effect unmistakable. For both parts, but the fairy doesn't comment on it or give of any sign that he's noticed. She does, however, nuzzle more into him. "I see... Apologies, I tend to be visited by the most leisurely of passerbys that think talking to a fairy about some manner of hex or ailment is like taking a vacation. It's serious business... I guess your state is quite dire though, so good on you for reacting quickly. If you have heating in your car then that is probably a better option than most things. I think Lydia's busy today so she couldn't even take you in, probably. And that'd be one of the better remaining options. So. We must go, to your car." 

The fairy is still quite bare, but she uproots a handful of grass and, holding it in her hand, transforms back into small. Curiously, his magic can settle the grass back into the cute plant coverings he had earlier, but... He only hovers just briefly before the both notice the biting cold set in now that the much less volumous fairy is producing considerably less heat. Swiftly, she poofs back, landing face first into the grass. 

"Well, fuck. That's not great."
Jaina — 11/18/2021
Shape winces as she plants into the grass, and he helps her off the ground with both arms, keeping the coat tucked around her. He wipes off the grass and dirt from her face with his hands and a bit of his shirt, and he admits, “This would be a bit easier if I had warm water. I think maybe we could.. Find some warm water for us too?” He wraps his arm around the fairy's back and walks him with him, at this point feeling the larger responsibility in getting them now both to a safe place. Sure, the fairy wouldn't die, but it would be very unpleasant otherwise to walk alone. And, yes, he recognizes that he literally feels warmer when she feels warmer, in an exaggerated symbiosis of things. Even if the warmth is, in some ways, a flavor of something Shape has experienced many times himself and herself in their life, and at this point they wonder would ever persist more than a few evenings in a row. Several minutes pass, and shadows stretch far in front of them. “Have you lived here your whole life, Anya, or are fairies like you pretty nomadic?”
Anya — 11/18/2021
"It's fine, don't worry about it. I do get a bit grimy from time to time. Such is being a mostly nakey fairy in the woods!" He's not wrong, too, now that she's no longer sitting in the grass it's instead the oversized jacket keeping him not too indecent. Warm water... There are springs and rivers but best of luck finding any with good temperature to it at this time of day. She dismisses the thought to herself, unless Shape somehow offers a better idea. 

"I have been here for a very long time, though I didn't settle here originally. I had some places earlier but none of them were quite as wonderful and homely as the grove. There's good people and life in these woods, this area. Much of magical potency to make use of for my abilities. The easier access I have to these things, the less people I have to disappoint and the more people I can cheat for their firstborn!" She giggles, but then adds. "Sorry, just a joke. There's so many rumors of fairies being the greediest bastards and having unreasonable demands, I've talked to people prepared to part with the most unnecessary things before. What am I meant to do with a baby? Weird lil' skin objects, they are."
Jaina — 11/18/2021
“Must be nice to be naked whenever you want, though. Sometimes I just want to be naked, but I also have to go out in public often, so what can I really do you know?” He pauses thoughtfully, continuing to lead the both of them to the car with a kind intimacy. There's off in the distance some artificial light they can make out briefly pass by, and another dimmer, more persistent one. “The grove, eh? If they're friends with you, they're friends with me.. Unless you're serious about the firstborn thing.” He returns a laugh too, and bites his lip. “Yeah, no worries. I heard all of those rumors. I also actually met fairies who were like that, but I mean so far I don't have much reason to doubt you, and the moment you do something kinda weird I think I'll be all right now. Actually, it maybe would be funny, when all things were well, that you show me a bit more about the sort of funny full 'magical potency' things you'd be capable of. I am awfully curious.” He pushes a finger on her tummy, before resuming a regular hold. The dim light in the distance is clearly part of the gas station Shape parked at, and the grove behind them is darker, denser, and more lifeless from the outside, especially at this time of falling night, than from the inside.
Anya — 11/18/2021
"Well, my strategy of being a mythical woodland creature that is above regular human standards has worked well for me but it's not something others can just adapt for themselves, I suppose. The people here aren't too excited to your average outsider but if you're nice enough I can put in a good word for you~" She wiggles slightly at the poke of the tummy, seeming just a little startled but flattered by his curiosity. 
Anya stops a bit, as she surveys the increasingly visible outside of the area. She doesn't venture out too often any more, and as time passes things always end up... different. There's a timeless peace to the grove in comparison, as if it intentionally rejects those who seek to make it adapt to modernity, rather than adapt themselves. Oh, and she almost completely forgot. Can't leave home without a note! In her hands she conjures a light orb similar to the one that originally greeted Shape, but this time a pulsating orange instead. He lets it go and it drifts away the direction they came from. 
"Okay. Gas station. Cars. Cool human technology. Let's go."
Jaina — 11/18/2021
“Yeah, even with my ability it's not like I can pretend to be a woodland druid for long before I'm expected to, I dunno, grow flowers from a rock or something. I'd appreciate a good word though, aw.” He smiles, watching the fairy's expression whenever he's not making sure the ground immediately in front of them doesn't dip into a crevice. The light orb is curious, and Shape watches it as well. And then he, finally, walks up a small hill into the parking lot of the gas station with Anya and digs in his pocket for his keys, which are thankfully clipped on. He unlocks the doors and they climb inside, and he turns on the vehicle to a low setting for heater while keeping the engine shut off. He lowers the music immediately, and slouches in the driver's seat. “I never thought I'd be so happy to hear country music again. You saved my life.” He reaches for the scented air freshener dangling from the mirror, and he hands it to Anya. It says “Pine-scented.” He shrugs, and breathes  slowly with the warmth of the car and the piece of Anya inside him.
Anya — 11/18/2021
Anya, having very little awareness of the general usage of a car up close, takes a few curious laps around the odd can of metal before finally, with some effort, managing to take up seat on the other side of the car and closing the door after himself. For the warmth. She accepts the funny little caricature tree and gives it a curious sniff. It sure smells like the vague idea of a tree. "So, Shape, why do humans decide to put real tree inside a fake tree? Isn't that what real trees are for? I'd generally prefer a pine over pine imitation cardboard." She does feel a bit more comfortable in the slowly heating car, but still wiggling a bit since she's just not... used to being cold.
Jaina — 11/18/2021
He taps his fingers on the steering wheel. He checks the phone he, in a frenzy, left in the car much prior. Nobody, not even from the person that inflicted the hex or something. He says, “I have never really thought of that before, but I guess it's because bugs exist, so like maybe there would be termites or ants trapped in the car if I tried to grow a small pine tree in the car instead. Also there might be space issues.” He reaches a hand back to Anya again, and sighs. “Yeah. Sorry, I know this isn't the most comfortable thing you've sat in. So I guess we're just going to be here all night, or maybe we should drive somewhere together if you prefer. I worry about taking us too far from your forest, though.” He looks in the side mirror, and continues, “I guess the gas station is also open? They'll have running warm water. And snacks. And a sad college student.”
Anya — 11/18/2021
"I tend to have the experience that the gas station kicks me out for being nakey if I don't impress them with my magics, but I suppose I can pass off as dressed with just the jacket with some hope." She ponders a bit, then smiles happily at Shape. "I want one of those tasty chocolate things. Snickles, I think they are. Something like that. You'll get me one of those, if you can. Since you owe me."
Jaina — 11/18/2021
Shape blinks a lot. “What? Why were you.. That's just pretty silly, I guess, but must have been for a chocolate bar, I guess, yeah. I'll grab you one here. Come.” He climbs out of the vehicle with Anya, closing his door for him and wrapping up the jacket a bit lower on their figure. It's low enough to work, and when they enter the small building its evident the cashier is really not going to put a fuzz. She is young, true to Shape's prediction, with dark lipstick and eyes only supported from Monster. Shape nods at her and leads Anya to the bathrooms, where he hesitates to place Anya in either bathroom briefly before choosing the men's room. Shape is presenting male, after all. “If you turn the faucet there you'll get a running stream of cold water with a bit of fluoride, the other faucet can warm it up.” 
Anya — 11/18/2021
The fairy eyes the wares quite curiously, now that she actually has the chance to do so mostly unhindered. He doesn't give any mind to the bathroom signs, not aware of this whole hassle of society in any way. He gives his attention to the curious knobs, and slowly manages to figure out how they're supposed to be operated. With some efforts and one displeased beep at some too warm water at some point, it settles at a moderate stream of good temperature. "Weird object. But I like it."
Jaina — 11/18/2021
“Nice. I'll be right back, I think I'll grab you your chocolate bar, Snicker's right?” He winks and leaves the bathroom. He makes quick work of finding the chocolate bars, but he spends an awkward amount of time figuring out which one is the regular one. No thanks to cookies and cream or peanut butter or dark. He takes the regular chocolate bar to the cashier, and during the purchase exchange of cash, Shape says, “You know, I was a little worried about that person in the bathroom earlier, but I'm starting to think they're kind of hot. They sort of saved my life and have a killer figure. I'm thinking I should get closer to them?” The cashier is apathetic, and says, “Sure, yeah.”
Anya — 11/18/2021
Anya spends some time fascinated by the mirror. She's more used to ponds and smooth reflective crystals and shards of polished metal or such. Seeing his face so clearly is almost eerie. But also very flattering! He does get started wiping off as much dirt and the likes he can, but. Also take a whole lot of time observing their own reflection. An untreated vanity being sated. Some very minor details being shapeshifted into place, nothing really noticable but if she's already at a mirror, she might as well take the chance. Soon enough, he's clean and fresh and decides to just run his slightly cool hands under a reasonably toasty stream of water, to soak in the warmth.
Jaina — 12/02/2021
Shape walks into the bathroom once more, and Anya's reflection in the mirror seems somehow more pristine than when he left. He chalks this up subconsciously to his increasing appreciation and sexual desire for the pink woodland creature. The chocolate plops beside the sink, and then his arms wrap around her midback. Shape squeezes lightly, and he leans more into and over her. The warmth of the orb increases once more, and Shape ducks his eyes from the reflection and smiles. “Did the water and I warm you? I got your chocolate bar, a small token of my appreciation for the fairy who helps me.”
Anya — 12/02/2021
Anya smiles warmly at Shape's reflection, and she nods appreciatively at the choice of chocolate. It's the one! She recognizes the color. 

As his figure gets enveloped in warm and caring arms, she lets her body lean back into Shape. The warmth is clear and mutual, and she hums delightedly. "Thank you for the treat! You did warm me, yes. I think... I think we both know what this added warmth is. And it'll make the time until we get you fixed much more comfortable." She rubs the back of her head into Shape's chest.
Jaina — 12/02/2021
Shape has never quite curbed the almighty unwanted erection. He ends up awkwardly pulling back his lower body during their moment of cuddly affection. And the enthusiasm in her voice and in her trust physically with Shape leaves him enchanted. It's not magic-- it's just trust.

He says to him, “I think I know what the warmth is too; it's your delight for your chocolate bar. Just kidding.” Shape laughs, and Anya can feel his chest shift. “Speaking of making our time until then more comfortable, I think we should head back to the car. I'm worried I'll get sick if I stand in here too long.” He gestures at the toilet with the wad of toilet paper. “We could just hang out back there.”
Anya — 12/02/2021
Anya nods. Car is warm and toasty. Just like shape is being right now, if you discount the biting cold that refuses to back down too much. "Yeah. We should. Some quiet and warmth and comfy is good for the soul." She picks up the chocolate bar and stuffs it into a jacket pocket. 
Jaina — 12/02/2021
“You have such a particular vocabulary. It's like warm itself, if that makes sense.” He walks with him out of the bathroom, and separates them from the hug midway. He holds Anya's hand, though, and keeps his side brushed to him. “But yeah, that was a good success. You got some warm water and chocolate.” Shape smiles at the cashier, once more, and Anya and him settle in the car again with the ignition turned on and heater running, although this time Shape keeps the gap between their seats bridged with the hand holding.
Anya — 12/02/2021
"I don't really care much if things make sense in the way most people would. It comes with being a fairy, you live to break with expectations. hehe." Anya cozies into his seat, warming his rear after having it mostly bare and out in the cold for a bit. She produces the chocolate bar, unwraps it a bit in the end and takes a surprisingly small nibble out of it before setting it aside on the dashboard. "Tasty. Just like I remembered."
Jaina — 12/02/2021
Shape nods, and stares at the tiny bite. “You have defied many expectations today, I have to admit. I was pessimistic going into this, mostly, so that was... where I was.” He slides some of his fingers between Anya's own fingers, locking up their held hands. “Tell me a bit about the last time you were out here buying chocolate. How did you get legal tender? I have a bit of a sweet tooth as well. Sometimes I can indulge it, like I used to love these milkshakes they'd sell in some diners...”
Anya — 12/02/2021
"Well I'm glad you turned around on that, I do like making it worth the time for people to bother me because honestly that doesn't happen quite as often! Seeing as the forest only really likes to accommodate people who have the spirit for it." 

He licks his lips, seeming to savor every bit of the chocolate nibble before even considering going back for more. "Nono. It wasn't like that. I was bored and people watching from one of the treetops when I spotted someone drop a weird object as they left. People rarely ever come back here soon once they go away so swooped in and took it! It was one of these. Fully clothed and all." She points at the chocolate bar, specifically the side that's still wrapped. "If it was something that seemed more special or important I'd have left it, don't worry."
Jaina — 12/02/2021
“I'm glad too, Anya, dear,” Shape says, with a polite inflection. “You'd think a ShapeShifter like me would have become pretty attuned to forests, live as a bear or something for a while, but I have always been rather indoors, and I just always found being human the best choice for me.” The flicker of memory about the house a child Shape briefly formed family bonds to comes to mind. He sighs, and rubs his chest. “Yeah, I suspect that the person didn't miss it. I'm glad you got to try one of these. You'll be delighted to know the human world is full of sugary delights, artificial and more, well, natural-aligned. Like, yeah, those milkshakes.” He stares into the pink eyes, and he says, “Oh well, no more human treats for you for a while, I suppose...”
Anya — 12/02/2021
"Maybe it's just in your nature! I hope this isn't rude or uncomfortable to ask. Are you. Are you a human-shapeshifter or a shapeshifter-shapeshifter? If you get what I mean." He carefully shifts some pink hair off his forehead. "I'm a fairy, after all, so it's natural I end up doing fairy things despite being able to shift into whatever, really." 

Her eyes latch on in return, and she seems temporarily captivated by this exchange of gaze. She's slightly flushed, slightly warmer. Despite a few blinks, he maintains for however long Shape intends to. "I suppose... Unless I magically, contractually bind you into being my supplier foreeever~"
Jaina — 12/02/2021
“I'm a human-shapeshifter. Like, yeah, I was born a human. Much like you came to as a fairy, maybe, yeah.” He leans more on the divider between the two seats, maintaining the gaze with more smiling. “I suppose it's normal to have your tendencies, then. Like how you would trick me to give you chocolate every so often, sure. How would I fall for something like that, pink creature? I'm very curious how such a deception works, if you'd so kindly give me an example.” Shape blinks slowly, and he lowers his chair back. He still maintains holding Anya's hand.
Anya — 12/02/2021
Anya leans in as well, smiling and giggling softly. Especially leant forward instead of sitting upright he seems so very petite of a figure next to Shape. "I don't think you'd need to fall for it, I'd simply state it as a binding clause for when I am to finally dispel your ailment. No monthly candy, and you'll pay the price for defying a fairy's demands~" 

Her eyes fall down Shape's face a bit, and... There's another spark of warmth in them both. She turns her face away, blushing.
Jaina — 12/02/2021
“Yeah, you're absolutely right. It's only fair, my most generous and pretty fairy Anya, that I return you the favor with monthly payments of candy.” Shape, though, suspects he'd visit more than that. He tugs on Anya's arm lightly, and he stays put in his laying position on the lowered head rest. Her giggle and smile are images that stick in his mind, even when his eyes are closed. And, catching her admiring his face in return, Shape teases him. “I think there's another way you can fall for something, or someone. Is your chair comfortable, hmm?”
Anya — 12/02/2021
Anya responds by taking the chocolate bar and securing herself another small gnaw on it, about the same as the last time. "Do make sure to add some good variation to the mix, then. I think only having... Snickers all the time will ruin a bit of the magic~ And yes, I'm quite comfortable. Passably. Not like I have many other places to sit in this car, hehe." Her glance passes over most of Shape as she says so. "Falling for people is surprisingly easy to do, yes. And it doesn't have to involve trickery and deceit."
Jaina — 12/02/2021
“We'd never run out of different chocolate bars for you to try, let alone other treats, or sodas, or maybe even desserts.” Shape says. He then yawns, and tugs on Anya once more. “Passable.. Yeah, that won't do, I'll remind you you saved my life. I bet you're still just a bit cold, and could use a little extra warmth. Is that right?” Honestly, the car is quite warm enough. The fairy isn't going to really need it. At least, not because he is physically chilly. Shape mumbles, “Yeah, trickery is just for making things happen one of the people doesn't want, I think... That's what trickery is.”
Anya — 12/02/2021
"Some extra warmth, you say? I would love that, certainly. What can you offer me, hmm?" She could very much manage as is, but whatever Shape may have in mind sounds very much delightful. He once again licks his lips to find any stray chocolate spots that may have eluded him. "Trickery is so many things, really, sometimes it's actually for the better too. But if you can achieve everything you desire without, then... There's no real reason to."
Jaina — 12/02/2021
Shape leans forward from his cozy position in his reclined seat, and he drapes his arms around Anya's shoulders, and he then clasps his back with this. Now, once more, the human shapeshifter tugs on the fairy. He keeps his sleepy eyes open, and he says, “I offer you my arms, and my chest. I'd be honored if you'd lay with me, my-- sexy savior.” He tries not to giggle, thinking the compliment to be awkward. Anya's lick is another one of those pleasant images that doesn't leave the mind. “Yeah,” he adds. 
Anya — 12/02/2021
Anya does not object or resist one bit, and with a single fluid motion he's made the way across the car and is sat in Shape's lap as best as the space of the car allows. "I accept, Shape. I've heard the phrase 'sexy' thrown about a few times my way but it feels... Different when you say it now, hehe. It's warmer. And I mean, I do try after all, I want to get my money's worth out of being a shapeshifter." His head rests against the chest, and they both are indeed warmer now. For various reasons.
Jaina — 12/02/2021
Shape, in the burst of excitement brought forth from the acceptance, rubs Anya's back and rustles his hair over and over, and Shape lays back down on his head rest at a low angle once more. Anya's brought down with him, pressed to his low incline chest. He says, “Thank you so much, you amazing fairy Anya, you're so cute and wonderful and fun so far I can't help but to have asked.” Seems a bit a departure of the excuse. He continues, “I'm glad I have a warmness to when I say 'sexy.' As a fellow ShapeShifter, I suppose I know all too well that you don't want to be seen as an object of beauty, you know, so the sexiness I'm describing is more than appearances, you know? You're sexy on the inside. You saved my life, and make me smile, and now I even want to hold you close.” As he squeezes the fairy against his chest, it's abundant how bright the orb gets.
Anya — 12/02/2021
Anya can't help but be amused over how gushy the poor other has become in her proximity. "You're impressively adorable. I do mean that I put effort into a being a sexy and beautiful creature since I'm able to do so! And if people think I'm sexy that's just confirmation of my talents! But. I can't shapeshift myself into an internally sexy person as easily so. It's a different kind of flattering to hear that. You're quite like that too, honestly? It's been a very cozy and warm time despite today being the coldest I've felt in so long."
She makes herself more comfortable in his lap. She's... still bare under the jacket and with how leant back Shape is she's properly settled in close to him. She knows. And she's very warm too.
Jaina — 12/06/2021
Shape nuzzles Anya, and his eyes start to close once more. He keeps the fairy and jacket over his chest when seeking the warmth of both for the night. He says to him with a more leveled air, “You are, in fact, quite talented. I've never seen someone do that thing with the orb, and have it be comfortable even.” The orb has been quite warm. “I'm very flattered you'd think of me as so sexy on the inside as well. I really try to be the best person I can be, but sometimes I'm not sure if I have.” And sometimes he's on a more selfish streak. But this was a mutual feeling. This orb was, always, warm. “I'm glad to keep you warm... That was a long day.”
Anya — 12/06/2021
Anya slowly settles in as well, starting to become quite snoozy. It's surprisingly comfortable, all in all, and while the warmth is still strong it seems a good time to fall asleep and hope it carries on through the night. "I hope you accounted for me sleeping here. It will happen now."
Jaina — 12/06/2021
Shape nods. “Wasn't letting you sleep cold,” He says. Shape is able to drift into a comfortable state of sleep. Anya manages to not only aid in that, like so much else today, but transcend everything Shape disliked about fairies. Maybe he just didn't give them a fair chance until now. More likely, Anya was a bit different.
Anya — 12/06/2021
The night passes uneventfully, and Anya sleeps through quite comfortably even if the cold has slowly set in again with the strong gay vibes having eased off a bit in the sleep. The sun cuts into the inside of the car as it rises over the east, separating the forest on its one side and more open land on the other. This is quite unusual for a fairy that lives in the woods, and he stirs, beeping softly.
Jaina — 12/06/2021
Shape mumbles and stretches his arms behind him, recognizing the events of yesterday. The pink hair of the fairy shimmers in the low sun. He rubs Anya's scalp. “Hey, you're up. I'm up now too.” He licks his lips, which are chapped. “That was really special. But I guess it's time for the ingredients. When I'm ready.”
Anya — 12/06/2021
The fairy makes some various grumbly noises as he stretches, not quite used to being awakened like this. But Shape's here and that's cozy. 

"So, yes. There's a few things we'll need. Nala owes me some favors so I can easily send message and expect to have her deliver some flarebloom at my house sometime during the day. I know where to get some nice catalytic crystals too. We won't need too much, Soulfire is pretty densely packed." She makes a few more mental thinkings. "And I think we'll have to see if Yarrow's in a good mood. Probably is though. I heard Lydia's been occupying her. She has... Things. In her Domain. That we need. Anyhow." 

The fairy sizes up Shape again. He's a bit scrawny and such, after all, which isn't ideal for a grove round trip, but it should be fine. "I hope you don't mind a bit of rocky terrain."
Jaina — 12/06/2021
Shape nods a few times, accepting that the fairy has a network of friends and not really wishing to get to know them in this compromised condition. “All right. I remember the flarebloom and soulfire the other day mentioned, right. I hope I don't keep you dragged behind or anything. I'll, yeah, try to hike with you through whatever. Rocky terrain is fine. Even if I only have sandals, they're a pretty good fit for this kind of thing. As long as rocks don't get lodged under my heel.” He moves his hand to the side of the chair, feels around for the lever, and then pushes it forward, lifting Anya, Shape, and the chair forward. He holds the petite Anya partway so that she doesn't fall off of him. And then he brushes some of her hair from her eyes. “Just grab your chocolate on the way out.” As they make a bit of room getting out of the vehicle, Shape grabs his key like before and this time his phone. He locks the car when they've both stumbled out.
Anya — 12/06/2021
Chocolate. Mmm. 
Anya makes sure to take the chocolate and achieve another nibble of it before carefully stashing it into a jacket pocket. Certainly handy, these pockets! Being out of the car means that he can finally stretch out his limbs properly which is what he does, quite impressively so. 

"Do you need to visit the house of trading for product to have some food or are you fine in that regard?" 
Jaina — 12/06/2021
“Oh, sure, yeah. I'll just buy some breakfast,” He says. He asks you to give him a moment, and he digs out his wallet again from the car, heads over to the gas station, and returns in a few minutes with a couple bagels and small packets of not-very-solid cheese and jelly. He spreads a plastic knife with some of this as he walks into the forest, gesturing Anya to follow. “And, again, if there's anything I can do to make this easier, I'll try, fairy hero.” 
Anya — 12/06/2021
The fairy hops after Shape, after resisting becoming a Fairy to fly after him. She recalls how inconvenient it was to be tiny and cold yesterday. "I think I'll manage better than you but I'll see if it comes up! Maybe I need someone taller than me to reach a thing since I'm not as easily able to fly right now." 

The two of them head loosely in the direction they came from, some of their own tracks still visible along the way. Anya seems to occasionally stop and observe, listen. As if there's something she's looking for.
Jaina — 12/06/2021
Shape eats all of one bagel, and he offers half of the second bagel to Anya to try with any curiosity. He remains patient through Anya's lead and search, not the first time Shape would just go with someone else's lead and never going to be the last. He asks Anya somewhere where the canopy is particularly tall and dark, “Oh, where could we find some fresh water? We might need that soon too.”
Anya — 12/06/2021
Anya gnaws upon the bread some, seeming quite content, but finally stops to swallow his bite. She motions for a bit of quiet. She whistles three sharp tones out into the forest, then repeats them. 
"We can get some water soon, sure. You don't have any... Allergies, do you? Just to be sure." She munches some more bagel.
Jaina — 12/06/2021
“I'm not allergic to anything, nah. I guess if I ever found something I'm allergic to, I could probably figure out how to rewrite something about my body to prevent that. But that's not really happened.” He faces out where the whistles went, blinking violently. “Echolocation? Outbound calls?”
Anya — 12/06/2021
"Oh, I'm just looking for a messenger, to aid my cause. A friendly and good one. You might like him." There's a brief silence, and then Anya turns to look past Shape. "Ah, there we go."
Fluffs — 12/06/2021
"Mrow."
Jaina — 12/06/2021
Shape turns around and is met by a cat. “Ah, right, like a furry friend. Kinda quaint.” He waves at it, and he steps aside a bit. Anya knows what to tell the cat, and cats are scratchy.
Anya — 12/06/2021
Anya leans down and gently pats the cat between the ears. It mrows contently.
"So, Fluffs, I need you to bring a message to Nala, okay? I know you're just a cat and won't understand the words I tell you so." She instead conjures another of her small magical glowy sprites, this time in a warm red color. She mumbles a few words into it and gently lowers it onto the cat, where it seems to hover around in close proximity to the fur even as the cat stops observing it and starts weaseling around Anya's legs. A cozy lil' creature, it seems.
Jaina — 12/06/2021
Shape smiles, and he approaches the two creatures only to hide behind a close and thin tree and peer again. This fairy magic had a very particular design and theme, it almost seemed more stable than other fairies. Perhaps this is what a fairy mastering their abilities appears like, orbs and orbs and more orbs?

He waits for Anya to send off Fluffs with the message, and he rejoins the fairy to ask about where to next and where the message was being sent to, again. He also says, “Cute cat though.”
Anya — 01/24/2022
Anya watches the cat trot off into the thick of trees, waving it goodbye, then addresses Shape again. "Next! I hope you have passable shoes. We need to go up a hill, a bit. There's a cave up the mountainside in... That direction. " She points. "Someone there has fairly exclusive access to a very important part of this. I'll actually get to join you on the walk this once, usually I'd just hover up there." 
She jumps slightly in her spot, seeming quite lighter than usual as she falls back down. He's never been a fan of walking barefoot over stony terrain but it's less of an issue when mostly unheavy.
Jaina — 01/24/2022
"Oh.. Well." Shape rubs the back of his neck. "Yeah, just sandals. But it's alright. I've walked a lot before. Surely it won't be too bad... I'm doing it no matter what, so. Thank you for keeping me company for this though. Here." He reaches for Anya's hand, and he starts walking off in that general direction with him. "We'll have a lot to discuss, maybe. Let's also get some water on the way there, like you said we could?"
Anya — 01/24/2022
This part of the forest, while thick around them, is in this path just a little more lenient. It's so peaceful and undisturbed, and yet you get the feeling more than enough creatures have passed here in their time. "We'll pass by a spring before we do the climbing, the water is quite fresh there. Say, I'm curious. What brings a shapeshifter to these parts anyhow? Well, apart from the needing a fairy to fix some oopsies, of course. I don't see  many magical beings stop by, the ones I know generally live here already."
Jaina — 01/24/2022
Shape's seen some wilderness only rarely in adventures. This place must have a biodiversity only short of the Amazon, judging from the variety of interesting small plants, some of which Shape would almost want to scan for magic. "Well, to be honest, I've been all over the place for most of my life. Almost a decade ago I settled down not too far away from the forests and mountains here, like a plains town with humans and not much else. I live there because, well, it's safe, it's small, even inexpensive. I've had trouble in the past just finding a home."  He squeezes Anya's hand. 
Anya — 01/24/2022
The thick slowly clears up again, and soon ahead of them lies a bit of a grassy clearing against the base of the rocky hills - It's a striking view and the fairy points out a small, snakey trail that leads upwards. "Hmm... Inexpensive. I'm really not familiar with how you- the humans tend to do this money thing. I was going to say that I don't pay for my lil' treehouse but I guess I did actually make it myself. I... Did actually seek out a good few places myself before I came here. Nowhere else offers quite this variety of resources and life and the people here are very nice too. I can actually help most of the time when people need me... I don't think I could have helped you out if you visited any of my former homes." The thought itches a slight bit. Anya picks up a rock as they leave the grassy terrain, if just to distract herself from those implications.
Jaina — 01/24/2022
"Money is.. Yeah. It was like started up basically because of wanting to normalize bartering systems into something more abstract. So, yeah, if a guy wanted five bundles of wheat and another guy was only selling sheep for it, he'd get way too much wheat if doing a fair deal, you know? So.. Money made it easier to sort of buy the exact amount of wheat he wanted, I guess. Did that make sense? I'm not big on the money thing either, but I make it work." Shape takes a deep breath as they reach a steeper path. You could roll down with a bad fall. He gazes at Anya. "I'm glad you can help everyone, not just me, here. And I have to admit your tree house was pretty cute looking. I just sort of rented my home... Which is like giving money to justify occupying space until you leave. The people here are nice?"
Anya — 01/24/2022
Anya simply gives some thoughtful nods to this notion of a bartering system. It kind of makes sense... Until the rent part comes up. But he's not eager to argue that. She gently puts the rock back down again, slightly further up the path. She trails off to the side as they pass an alcove in the hillside, which upon closer inspection seems to be partially cut out by hand, if roughly. Out of the back wall trickles a small stream of water, down into a crudely shaped bowl of sorts which currently is overflowing and spilling onto a small groove drawing the water aside. It's surprisingly refined of a system for how little effort into reshaping nature has been done, fitting the nature of this place as a whole. "It's usually quite cold, but it's good water." She dips her hands in and scoops some out, drinking it.
Jaina — 01/24/2022
Shape keeps close to the rock wall, afraid he might slip on a particular bit of loose gravel. At the irrigation into a drinking fountain of sorts, Shape nods and reaches for the bowl after Anya finishes her own drink. He manages to drink less water than her for his first go, but he cleans up the act for subsequent carries and sips. He says, with a wet shirt collar, "I prefer room temperature water, yeah. This will do, though. This is really quite fresh." He intentionally rubs some water onto his own face, and he then gives the bowl space, still keeping close to the rock wall and Anya secondarily when they continue on their way. "Where I'm at, people are nice, but there's only so many that are magic or that I can trust. I actually often have to meet visitors for that kind of thing now."
Anya — 01/24/2022
Before they leave, Anya quickly scoops a majority of the water out of the bowl. It slowly starts filling back up again. "Bit of a common courtesy. It's not like the water gets a wasted and it makes sure it's fresher for the next person." He shakes his hands off, making sure that there's minimal left before wiping them on the borrowed Jacket. "Aww... That's a bit of a shame. Well, you're. Certainly welcome to stop by here later on if you feel like it." Anya hops over a fairly big rock, and soon their goal starts coming into view. It's unseeming at first, but on top of a somewhat prominent overhang there's a cave, which judging by the sunlight falling deep into the entrace seems to be facing almost directly south. It's closing in on noon. "We came here at the right time, it seems. Ophelia's bound to be in a good mood and easy to find. She... well. She feeds off sunlight. It's been pretty nice weather for a few days. Now, remember to be on your best behavior. We need her assistance for something she has." As we round the corner, the cave really doesn't seem that deep at all. In the back, there's a shimmering pool of water. And... Apart from some smaller offshoots and alcoves, the place seems empty of life.
Jaina — 01/24/2022
Shape says, "Yeah. I just might. If you're so sweet, your friends probably are too. Could make good day trips out of this. Maybe figure out a sleeping arrangement in a camping tent if I can figure out where I put that old kit." And, later, he puts his hands on his knees and breathes in, and he says, "Okay.. That's good. I needed to maybe chill for a bit anyway. Possibly away from the very warm sunlight, unlike Ophelia here. Like in some more shade again, you know... I'll be nice, I promise." Shape continues toward the cave at Anya's discretion, slowly. He has to wonder if Ophelia is maybe hiding or away from home, given the totally empty nature of the cave and all... He smiles anxiously, and he puts his hand over where Anya's orb of warmth rests under. "I really hope she's here." 
Anya — 01/24/2022
Anya giggles, and walks over to the pool of water that spans the back end of the cavern. There's an assortment of larger rocks around it, and she motions to the shaded area behind one of the taller ones. "She's always here, silly. It's not like she can just leave. You just need to... know where to look." She takes a small rock, attaches a glowing orb to it and drops it into the water. The orb follows the rock down. If Shape were to step closer, he'd see that there's much more to it than one would expect - The pool is considerable deep, an extension of the cave itself that goes quite deep, and there's an eerie glow in many different colors down in the depths. And a more purplish speck of that glow starts to move, up, towards the surface.
Ophelia — 01/24/2022
It doesn't take long for the figure causing the glow to breach, a pair of glowing purple eyes peering out from the surface before drifting over to the shore. Ophelia leans her arms on the side of the pool, resting against it and giving Anya a quick glance before eyeing over the stranger beside him. She appears to be somewhat of a mermaid-y nature, but more... plantlike. 

"Ah, Anya. I was planning to take a sunbath anyways, it's such a nice day. I see you have company! Who might you be, then?"

Jaina — 01/24/2022
"Where to look?" He says, as he retreats to the shade and gazes into the pool to his astonishment. Something tells him that he shouldn't hang in the deep end, but despite that he takes off his sandals and dips his toes into the water, having a proper seat on the side. But, with Ophelia's greeting, Shape quickly pulls his feet out and smiles awkwardly. "Oh, hey, Ophelia, Anya was just telling me about you and uh. Yeah I'm Shape, I've come around to the grove because I had a horrible thing happen where my heart's been frozen by a pretty nasty ice spell. The only reason I'm doing alright right now is because of something temporary, but Anya and I were looking for a more permanent solution, and I guess this watering hole had an important ingredient for the spell?" Shape, holding his wet toes, stares at Anya for clarification. And he says anyway, "I like your hair, also... Are you a mermaid? That's amazing." 
Anya — 01/24/2022
Anya is quite amused by how flustered and surprised Shape is being, and simply interjects. "Yeah, he got himself into an oopsie and now I'm trying to save his life. Y'know, usual fairy stuff. Concentrated soulfire will do the trick, so I politely request a rubium shard. Preferably a higher grade one, this really isn't your everyday hex".
Ophelia — 01/24/2022
The mermaid seems, as predicted, reasonably cheerful and smiling warmly as the sun is now washing over her face. "Oh, you're a curious one. You've come to the right place! I cultivate crystals of many sorts in these waters, the magical essence in this lake is highly potent and likes to solidify if given the right seed to gather around. It's certainly a good pastime considering I live here full-time. I am indeed some manner of mermaid, though I think you'll find the more common myth ones to be more... meaty. Let's not get too existential, but I am pretty sure I was just a regular kind of plant until all this magic essence got to me."

"I do have to ask though, what's your bargaining power like?" She stares at Shape, expectingly.
Jaina — 01/24/2022
"Yeah! Thanks fairy. That's the stuff." Shape just wishes he had a towel to dry his feet with while listening about this remarkable underwater crystal garden of sorts, and its plant mermaid... He puts his hand, once more, over where Anya's orb of warmth is as Ophelia talks about 'bargaining power.' "I have to say, Ophelia, I'm just glad we have wonderful cavern ladies such as yourself, plant or meat. Forgive me maybe, I promise I'm not totally naïve to magic circumstances, I just haven't met a mermaid before. Anyway..." He runs his index finger and thumb on his cold lips. And he nods. "I'll bargain. I really could use your generosity, and I'm a desperate and kind person. So I'll do or give what I'm capable of here..." Hopefully within reason. "I don't have much on me physically, unfortunately." 
Ophelia — 01/24/2022
Ophelia and Anya simply laugh in unison. As if there's a joke that Shape simply isn't in on. "It's funny every time, isn't it? I really don't have high prices and getting to do what I just did is almost a payment in and of itself though. But if you do have anything- Oh, that'll do nicely." She says, noting the fairy holding up half her remaining chocolate bar. "It's hard to come by good snacks in a mountain cave, and while I only need light I do appreciate a treat on occasion."
Anya — 01/24/2022
Anya hands over the bit of chocolate, and then turns to Shape. "I would have warned you, but she's right. It's very funny. If you want to raise the monthly candy delivery you'll owe me slightly, I'll make sure she gets some of it too." 
Jaina — 01/24/2022
Shape laughs sort of after they do, very concerned until he isn't. He just puts a palm on his forehead and smiles. "Yeah, Ophelia, I'll happily get you some chocolate or whatever else other candy you'd like monthly! That's fine. I already owe Anya anyway, she really snuck that one on me. Devious. Maybe just make sure to relay Anya about if you want a specific kind a month in advance so I can prepare it for next time." It's beyond Shape how she'd end up processing chocolate if her main intake is sunlight, but that's a question for another day. He leans forward on a rock facing the pond. "Well. Just know I'm happy to talk over the sweets then and there probably as well. I could really use more friends. But yeah, anyway."
Anya — 01/24/2022
As Ophelia dips away to search for appropriate magic rock, Anya shuffles over to Shape and leans against him. She takes the now lesser amount of chocolate, and nibbles on it again. "I can't tell if you're truly this excited to do this much nice things to people, or if it's due to the whole being mortally in danger thing. But it's very sweet. It'll be nice to have you around on occasion, truly, I almost want to say you don't have to return if you don't want to. But I guess it's a selfish desire to make you show up again." She rubs a hand against the back of her neck. "I, uh... Like you, I suppose."
Jaina — 01/24/2022
Shape finds great ease in wrapping both arms around Anya, thinking back on last night once more. He says with a tender stillness, "It's a healthy mix of both. I do like helping people, and I really should live at least a bit longer to achieve that. I'm happy to make sacrifices for those important to me. So, yeah, I'll get your chocolate. I really do want to return to the Grove for you in particular." He pushes Anya's hand aside for a moment, locking his fingers  with his. "I like you too. Nobody's ever really saved my life and really meant to. I think... And do you remember us in the car..? You're gorgeous where it matters most." He sort of laughs to himself, then, and admits, "Maybe I like that you're selfish about keeping me around. At least that we're being honest about what we want."
Anya — 01/24/2022
The warmth that Anya shares with Shape blooms once more; it had already been thawing over the last moments but there's a distinct heat that fills the both of them right now. "You're... Ah. You're so nice. I look forward to it all, and..." She closes her eyes, and, for a moment one could almost forget the cold entirely. She swiftly leans in and kisses Shape on the lips. It's planned to be just a peck but once she's connected, she finds it hard to pull away again. The delightful heat of her emotions quelling the cold doesn't help.
Ophelia — 01/24/2022
Having quietly breached just a moment ago, Ophelia realizes it's maybe a bad moment to disturb and simply lingers at the surface, watching quite curiously.
Jaina — 02/17/2022
Shape lifts his arms for a short moment, caught in surprise, and then he returns them to wrap around the fairies torso once things settle in. Her warmth, on her lips and in her orb inside him, made the moment more than special. He rubs into his back and sustains the kiss for many more seconds, and when he finally breaks the two of them apart, he says, "I... Wow, I really look forward to it too. You're amazing." He smirks awkwardly at the watchful Ophelia, and he says, "I didn't come in expecting this, it just sort of happened." When he turns back to Anya, though, he winces and puts a hand on his own chest again.
Anya — 02/17/2022
As soon as the Fairy has come back to her senses again, she flushes deeply red and hides her face, especially upon realizing Ophelia is back. She doesn't make any efforts to slink away though. "Sorry, sorry, aaahh... Oh! Are you okay? :( We really should get going, we can do... More of that afterwards. Maybe. Do you have the object, Eli?"
Ophelia — 02/17/2022
"Yes, I have what you need. It's a prime variant, but you two look like you deserve it." She carefully places a softly glowing red shard onto the shore, the shape of it almost looking like it was manually cut and not grown in a pool.
Jaina — 02/17/2022
"Yeah. I'm alright." He closes and opens his eyes, and lets go of his chest. His breath, though, has a bit of a frosty breeze. "Mm. You're right though. We should get going. Unfortunately. Thank you Ophelia that's really nice of you--." Shape walks over to the red shard and lifts it up. He walks away from the shore and in the direction of the cave entrance, looking back at Ophelia apologetically. "I'd stay longer and chat if this wasn't more urgent. Come on, Anya, let's... Yeah."
Ophelia — 02/17/2022
She understands, and simply smiles and waves slightly towards Shape. 
"You better save him, Anya. He's cute. You two smooching, that's cute. Would be a shame to lose that."
Anya — 02/17/2022
Anya pops up on her legs and follows Shape out. While the trek up to the cave wasn't too long, the view from this platform overlooks at least the northern reaches of the trees, which seem to be shorter than the heart of the grove. Anya points out to a somewhat less pleasant looking area in that direction. "Out there. The swampy place. We're looking for a plant that's both dead and alive, the Necrolily. Be warned, Yarrow's actually a bit of a bitch, especially compared to Ophelia."
Jaina — 02/17/2022
Shape seems to be walking a bit faster than Anya's pace at all times, and he constantly has to slow down or ask if they're going in a certain direction before walking ahead. He says, sometime after Anya clarifies where they're headed, "I hope we can get that plant, then. I really do. I'll do anything. I'm honestly quite scared, suddenly. And, well, at least a fairy's going to be really upset if I die now, isn't he? Someone to know if I pass away, except like Vera I guess..." The shapeshifter sighs, and he stops at one point just to kiss the fairy on the lips again, much more briefly. "And I want more of that. More of you. You know? Maybe I'm not too old and worn. I dunno. I really feel something with your lips." Shape is utterly rambling.
Anya — 02/17/2022
"You're going to make me cry..." He makes a small whine, and makes sure to keep up Shape's pace as best she can. She feels the cold sting again too, and knows he has it much worse. She'd be willing to pick a fight with Yarrow for once if needed, and that's a tall order. They make good headway, this edge of the forest is much less dense than what they trekked through earlier. "You'll... Ah, never mind. We can figure that if necessary. For now, we need plants to happen. I hope Fluffs is back when we get to my house."
Jaina — 02/17/2022
Shape winces again and slows down for a few steps as they approach the edges of the swamp. He steps around a dead log and sighs. "Thank you for everything once more. You're not only the only reason I'm even alive, you're also kind of giving me reason to try harder. Yeah." Shape nods. "Plants... I hope the cat is too. Really we'd have done so much to get to this point. In such a short amount of time... So, I wanted to mention, I come from Germany, fairy. A distant country. I came here a bit over forty years ago in the search for freedom. People were hunting me down because of my powers. Powers I barely understood. I was ten years old, Anya." He runs his hands across his own arms. 
Anya — 02/17/2022
"Oh god, that sounds dreadful. I've had some people maliciously try to seek me out but not nearly anything of that sort..." As the trees are clear enough to give good sight and the ground is icky enough to warrant watching your step, Anya stops at a strongly wet patch of mud. She sighs, and sticks her hand into it, closing her eyes. There's a slight tingle of magic that passes through the sickly grass around. Not outgoing, though. Incoming.
Jaina — 02/17/2022
"...Yeah. And the worst part is I didn't even escape my problems, you know? In America I had to deal with lingering government search for me, the occasional magic-seeking cult member. I actually got captured on one occasion. It's amazing I got out. And, you know, I was basically just going from home to home. Sometimes I impersonated someone who I knew lived there but not around, or pretend to be someone who was booked to a hotel room but wasn't. Sometimes I was a child just to get sympathy. But sometimes I was homeless. And sometimes, I really didn't want to be homeless, and I'd..." He frowns and stares around at the disgusting, magically-charged grass. He stands closer to Anya, even in mud.
Anya — 02/19/2022
Anya listens to this rambly retelling, and makes a slightly upset sighing noise. "I'll make sure that wasn't all for nothing, and to fix that... We need to go that way." She wipes off her hand feebly in the grass, and then points off along the edge of the swamp. "I could say a lot of things but we're short on time, possibly. So there's this Dryad. Yarrow. She supposedly drowned in this swamp over three hundred years ago, but somehow wasn't entirely dead all that time. And by the time some manner of questionable magic brought her back to life, her spores and roots and magic had spread throughout all this mud and grime. She senses it all, to some extent. And she's very full of herself, knowing that she basically owns all this area full of things that people desire. She's smug and swampy and undead, and acts the part. She has... Some weaknesses though. We'll get you that flower." Anya shivers slightly, and pulls her jacket a bit closer. Staining it with mud from his hand in the process.
Jaina — 02/19/2022
Shape sighs as well, then. He lets the fairy talk, and he grabs onto Anya's borrowed jacket when he's done. "So, is Yarrow going to appear here or should we keep looking for her?.. I can't say I've dealt much with magic pertaining to the very nature of life and death itself. Fitting that I'd do it now. I guess... Yes, the undead flower. Of course." And he seems like he's going to cry. Overdue, some would say. But Shape is less ready than he was yesterday. He stares at Anya's eyes from the side.
Anya — 02/19/2022
The two appear at a path of dirt that's a bit more firm than most of this land, edging on what almost seems to be a pool of grimy water. It's quiet, but Anya seems to be sure they're at the right place. She picks up a small rock and drops it into the pool with a nasty little 'blup' sound. 

...

"Yarrow. I know you're there. Any other day I'd play game but it's pretty serious this time."
Yarrow Fowler — 02/19/2022
There's a slow shift in the water, and a peculiar figure emerges rolling a pair of piercing orange eyes. 
"S'up."

Jaina — 02/19/2022
Shape keeps the distance from himself and Anya to nothing, and he stares at the emerging dryad of the dead and ick with some tears. He swallows. "Anya has kept me temporarily alive from a horrible curse I've been afflicted to freeze my heart." He again holds said heart under his chest, and he continues after losing his breath, "And we're so close to creating a permanent solution. We just need a Necrolily. Please, Yarrow." He squeezes Anya's shoulder, and he looks down from Yarrow's steely eyes. 
Yarrow Fowler — 02/19/2022
"Ah shit. You keep dragging these people in but that does seem worse than most of them. Where do you keep finding them? I get all the explorers and collectors that are way out of their waters." There's a pause, and Yarrow sinks down deep enough to form some bubbles when she hmms thoughtfully. "Look, I was ready to make a whole deal of making you work for it but..."
Anya — 02/19/2022
"I'll whine to Lydia if you manage to botch this entirely by being stubborn. I'll find you a payment later, I promise, but this isn't the time. I'm sorry. I'll even throw in a Rose Orchid, guaranteed. You can't say no to that." Anya sighs with some manner of relief, happy that Yarrow isn't a complete nuisance for once.
Yarrow Fowler — 02/19/2022
There's an annoyed groan. "Okay, but next time I will drive a hard bargain. You caught me in a good mood." She shoots a look to Shape, almost expectantly.
Jaina — 02/19/2022
Shape nods and continues to cry anyway, relieved that the dryad is taking pity on what's effectively a stranger with connections. He says, words tumbling over one another, his eyes beaming with youth, "Yarrow thank you so much-- thank you thank you thank you. Oh my god." He wipes his eyes with his free arm, and he then he feels for his heartbeat with it. "I understand completely. I really do. I'll play that game another time... So, right, the Necrolily? How's that work..?" He glances between Anya and her, hopeful. He thinks about Anya and him making out.
Anya — 02/19/2022
"It's a big need, Yarrow, so we'll need the bulk of it. Roots and leaves and all that mass. Don't have to be a perfect plant, just a fairly large one." There's a soft, pleading tone in his voice, infected by Shape's desperation.
Yarrow Fowler — 02/19/2022
Yarrow closes her eyes for a bit, and focuses. Sensing. "There's some nearby. Give me just a minute." She clambers up on the dry land next to them, and the full extent of her size becomes clear once she's not shoulders deep in the mud. She much be at least seven feet tall, towering over the small fairy. She paces past them, dripping off continuously - She doesn't even vanish out of view as she carefully tilts a hollow and dead, partially submerged tree trunk off the ground. Reaching her hand in, she procures a greyish white plant, along with the mount of dirt it was sitting in. It looks vastly unhealthy and yet full of life somehow, as if it's at the prime of a very miserable life. Yarrow returns, and basically shoves it into Shape's hands. "You owe me. Try not to die so that you can repay me."
Jaina — 02/19/2022
Yarrow's impressive figure, once fully walking about, interests Shape about as much as he could be given the underlying circumstances. He couldn't even imagine being three hundred whole years old-- probably another odd twenty years atop of that. The amount of people who would become friends with Shape and die, the amount of memories that would pile and shove away older ties. Shape stares at the white withered and bloomed thing in his hands, detecting through his abilities and its soil perhaps the rarest and most intimidating form of magic, necrotic magic. He nods, and says, "Of course. Thank you..." He shivers, and he presses his hands and dirt just about against him. He starts walking back from the pool from the direction Anya and him came, and he says hardly louder, "I would stay if there was any time... I'll just say I like your nail polish, and that this magic is something special... Come on, Anya." 
Yarrow Fowler — 02/19/2022
Yarrow huffs slightly. You can tell that it's an attempt to seem offended by the quick retreat, but it doesn't work. "...Good luck with that, Anya. He seems to deserve it."
Anya — 02/19/2022
The fairy nods and quickly scurries after Shape, then nudges him to the side a bit. "It's a bit more in that direction, we don't need to wrap all the way around the forest again. I know the good paths here. And uh... Good job being absolutely pitiful, I suppose. She's rarely that agreeable but she's not inherently careless or dismissive."

"Also, her girlfriend would disapprove. Don't tell her I said that. The two kind of deny being a thing but it's like the most obvious thing of all. You should meet Lydia sometime in the futrure." 

Despite passing through thicker forest, there always seems to be a traversable line somewhere in all this thicket. While so full of life and dense, it's clear that a lot of creatures and beings pass through here with much care for nature instead of carving a path. And the forest gives way, in return.
Jaina — 02/19/2022
Shape takes the new direction, and he walks ahead of her in shorter bursts than before the swamp. "I wasn't trying to be pitiful," He says. "It must have just came across that way. And I'm glad even someone like her can end up with a romantic partner. I'd love to meet Lydia someday... You know everything, Anya. None of this would have been possible without you. I can't let you forget how grateful I am for this chance. I might make it." He stares at the Necrolily as they step through the greenery. It's beautiful. "The world conditioned me to think I was a problem, a monster. I thought I was as strange as Yarrow, an alien to life and its creatures, in my case simply adopting their forms to appear normal. I thought this ways for a long time, actively and then subconsciously in a longer form of self-doubt. Eventually, though, I learned to accept myself. I made friends. And I embraced that I could be any age, any human form, and later any gender. And I wanted to be twenty-one forever."
Anya — 02/19/2022
"You're... considerably insightful. I wonder how you'll feel about all you've said when you're okay again, hehe." They're approaching where Shape found Anya originally, and even ahead of their return he whistles the same three tones from earlier, trying to notify the cat that they're on the way. It's cold. Very cold. The fairy does her best to hide that she's suffering too by now, doesn't want Shape to feel bad for him.
Jaina — 02/19/2022
Shape wishes he could hug Anya instead of holding the Necrolily, for warmth and for comfort. Instead, his eyes wander around them. "Come on, Mittens. Come on now... Yeah, I guess I've been-- filling you in on my life. I want you to know who I am... Like how the way I viewed my age--" Shape gasps, and he buckles to his knees, keeping his grip on the plant although shedding some of its soil. His breathing has grown heavier as if the air's thinned. "Mm. Anya. I'm sorry. This is my fault. Remember." He whimpers.
Anya — 02/19/2022
Anya stops, and kneels down next to Shape. "Fuck, we're so close, we really just need to get those flareblooms and everything will probably be okay again... Please..." She whistles again, more urgently, and starts rummaging for some rocks. She drags over a rather flat slab and starts picking at the Necrolily, stripping off the dirt and laying it out across the stone. "I need the Rubium, you took it. I just want to be as ready as possible for when-"
Fluffs — 02/19/2022
Some leaves rustle, and the cat pops out of a bush, dropping a satchel from her mouth. "Mbrrp." She headbutts Anya gently, and receives some quick but loving pats as a reward.
Jaina — 02/19/2022
Shape reaches into his pocket with his freshly freed and dirtied hands, producing the prime example of Rubium from Ophelia. And he hands it to Anya weakly. He sits on the earth. And he curls up his legs and arms and shivers them all freely, without expectations. "If something doesn't work, remember... This is my fault alone. You did everything you could." He  shuts his eyes as if it would remove the struggling. And he shakes his head sometimes. "But... You put so much into this. I believe."
Anya — 02/19/2022
"Please, just have faith for three more minutes, we're almost there..." She pries open the satchel, tearing it in the process and receiving a displeased mow in response. Anya can fix it later, not now. The flarebloom is woven carefully around the limbs of the miserable little plant with the rubium sitting in the middle of it all. And - The fairy isn't at all adept in fire but it really just needs a spark of pink energy to set it all ablaze, a terrific crackle that would consume any regular plant in mere seconds. But the undead mass keeps feeding the blazing little fire, which the gem absorbs continuously. There's no heat that radiates outwardly. Anya watches, counting lowly to herself. "I can't rush this. It has to be enough."
Jaina — 02/19/2022
Shape's tipped over to his side in this fetal position. His hair is in the soft, cushioned grass. He thinks of it as very comfortable. And he knows if he waited he might fall asleep eventually, probably forever. Maybe this is what older people mean when they can know when their time has run out even before they sleep. Something Shape's read about, anyway. But, well, it isn't Shape's time. Anya is making sure of that. Shape wants to know what tomorrow holds for him, and the day after that, and so on, knowing he can see the fairy in the forest who truly kissed him at his worst.

He lifts his head from the grass, and then resumes hugging himself sitting upright. "Yeah. Of course."
Anya — 02/19/2022
"...Now." Anya dumps a pile of wet dirt onto the fire, stifling it with a ferocious sizzle. He quickly rummages, pulling out the gem. 
It's surprisingly not physically warm to the touch and easy to hold, but through their connection Shape can feel a wave of strong emotional energy, roaring life, pass through both of them. Soulfire. Anya pants quite struck by this different warm sensation as he takes the gem and a rock in his hands. She pushes shape's arms aside, and tears open his shirt. 
"This will suck, a lot. Have fun." She strikes the gem with the edge of the rock, shattering one of the pointed edges. And she jabs its jagged surface against his skin, drawing slight blood. 

What Shape felt from Anya's connection was nothing. 
Every inch of Shape's mind, soul, emotions, is seared, invigorated, enveloped in figurative flames as the gem no longer absorbs or holds onto all this power.
Jaina — 02/19/2022
Shape's confused by the strong orb's energy inside of him, but it's very welcome in this dire time.. And then, when Anya prepares Shape for the final solution to this curse and then stabs it right along his skin, he almost screams but is stopped by the flames of the emotions and mind, unable to even process the response for this total flame of a person. He suffers in a quiet hell, deprived of everything but blazing heat. And the short time span manages to lose much meaning.

Everyone who's loved him comes to mind, and every way he's felt in his life seems important, when the Rubium's reserve depletes. His legs stretch out, and he recollects who he is and what miracle's just happened. How, too, all the cold has gone, leaving only the normal cool breeze anyhow of the forest.

Shape says, through teeth and exhaustion, "You did it..." 
Anya — 02/19/2022
Anya rests a hand on Shape's exposed chest, allowing himself to finally withdraw the borrowed orb again. She's gasping, trembling. He partook in all of that too, after all. And she lets herself simply fall over next to him. "You felt warm again. We did it. I can relax, now..." Her eyes flutter slightly. Anya feels like he could sleep for several hours after that fierce toasting. "We probably shouldn't fall asleep though. We're kind of just on the forest floor."
Jaina — 03/10/2022
"I am... Not moving." He reaches out his arm to the fairy, tapping him weakly. And eventually he finds the side of the fairy and pulls the fairy closer to his shoulder and side. The ShapeShifter is warm to the touch. "I just want to be limp."
Anya — 03/11/2022
The fairy doesn't hesitate to scoot close, and sighs. "We need to do something, eventually. But you're right... For now, nothing is good too. I missed flying this past day, but I don't want to be a small creature right now. I just want to be the right size for our arms." He rests his head against the shoulder.
Jaina — 03/11/2022
He closes his eyes and nods, and he says in careful redundancy, "Thank you... For everything." He seems less responsive in minutes, his breathing seems to mellow, and then he's fallen asleep. He's relieved, and he still has purpose and place in the world.
Anya — 03/11/2022
-------------
Despite his attempted concern and annoyance at the situation, Anya had soon after fallen asleep too and some hours pass before she stirs awake again. She slinks out of Shape's arms by becoming smaller, and pats him a few times on the cheek with some small hands. "Sleepyhead. Snoozypants! Time for lying in the grass is over."
Jaina — 03/11/2022
Shape mumbles and nearly swats the fairy off his cheek. He stops himself partway, though, and wiggles around to a hunched stand. He rubs his eyes. "I.. think I have it in me now. Well, wow, I guess that means... Well. I don't know what it means. I kind of want to just kiss you uncontrollably, to be honest. You saved my life, this time for real, for good." He opens his eyes to the fairy that's returned to fairy-size and flying, however, and smiles. "Aw, I thought you looked sort of cute in my sweater."
Anya — 03/11/2022
Anya giggles, and pecks Shape on the nose. She is, again, undressed not bothering to magic up a plant weave for herself again, but such is something you must simply get used to from a forest fairy. "I need to stretch my wings on occasion and turning your sweater tiny is maybe not what you want from me. Making it bigger again is more difficult, after all!" She does a few circles and flips in the air, and then yawns quite impressively as she settles in pace again. "So, um... What's your plan now?"
Jaina — 03/11/2022
Shape watches the remarkable little fairy in flight, and he then yawns in return. He points his finger somewhere. "I guess.. Well. If that's the way to my car, I guess I need to go home. Even though I've been really having a lot of fun, and really like you. We'll at least see each other every month.. Although, honestly, I think I'd be feeling pretty alone now back home. Knowing you're out here." He puts his hand down and bites his lip. "You could keep the sweater, shrink it down if you like. I'll just make a new one soon anyway. Comes in part with my shapeshifting... I know I already sort of told you this, but you look very pretty, Anya. Even when you're a little naked thing... I was sort of thinking maybe we could just sleep in my car again? Before I have to go home? I don't know." 
Anya — 03/11/2022
Anya rubs the back of her neck, and sighs... "I've enjoyed you too. I'd miss you when you leave. That's not usually how these encounters go. I'm glad you find me pretty, and I'd love to join you for one more rest." He considers the sweater for a bit, before carefully letting it turn small as she puts her hands on it. Some fizzly dust emits from it, excess mass being removed. It certainly would be harder to reverse that. She tries to put it on, and realizes that's not really effective with her wings. "Ah. Awkward."
Jaina — 03/11/2022
He says, "Yeah, I guess I don't know what most encounters are like, but you're not at all the fairy I first imagined, so I can't imagine you being much else than a sweetheart... Let's have one more rest together. We could head there right now unless there's anything you'd like maybe at your place?" The fairy's shrinking magic in some ways mirrors the "magic sand" Shape's own abilities manifests mid-transformation, and so Shape studies it closely. He shakes his head, and he says, "I suppose you could always punch some slits for those wings later?" And he walks away from the patch they slept on and hopefully the fairy-approved right direction.
Anya — 03/11/2022
"Mmm... Oh, speaking of things to want. Haven't you eaten like... One bagel today? Usually that's not a lot but you aren't a 'usually' kind of human so maybe that's just fine for you. I can arrange food but it'd be small and not enough for you. I myself could find a berry and I'd probably be good for the day!" She picks up the sweater and flies it up to her house, and quickly returns again. "I don't want you flopping over from lack of food right after I went through all this effort."
Jaina — 03/11/2022
"Oh.. Yeah, honestly I was so stressed out I forgot I have barely eaten anything these past couple days, even. I could use a large meal." Shape sighs. "Well. As much as I'd be tempted to pig out at the gas station on random garbage, I think I probably really should eat at a restaurant? I have the money, I just kinda didn't want to leave you alone... I don't suppose you wouldn't want to come along? It'd be even a bit further from the forest than the gas station... But if you didn't want to come along that's okay. We could just meet up in the parking lot." He shrugs. "I'm sorry this is all really awkward. I guess I haven't been around a fairy this long before. I'm willing to try and make our night work, though. Like I was thinking you haven't even seen proof I'm magic yet, too, and I'd like to show you."
Anya — 03/11/2022
"Well I don't have any clothes and those places probably care more about being proper, so I could sit in your pocket but then you'd be talking at yourself and that surely would come across as odd to everyone else. Maybe you should just... Go get that sorted, yeah. I'll be happy to wait for you. I need to fix Nala's pouch I tore trying to get you on your feet faster, and I'd find a snack too in your away." She does sound a bit sad though at the thought. She perches herself on Shape's shoulder, and stretches. The wings flutter softly, causing a peculiar breeze against his cheek. "I'd love to see that, hehe. Shapeshifting? You'll have to show me what silly things you can achieve~"
Jaina — 03/11/2022
"I'd say you could just sit in my pocket, yeah, but you're a bit bigger than my pocket still. And although I don't mind how odd you'd make me seem to the uninitiated, I'd definitely just be more concerned with revealing a fairy to normal humans by accident." He attempts to nuzzle the fairy with his cheek, although it's a bit tricky. And he says, turning his head to him as manageable, "So I guess I'll just drive on back. And then, tell you what, I'll do you the classic and I'll appear as anyone you might want. Maybe don't pick something you won't want to cuddle with, though. I don't want to change again until maybe morning... So, I guess see you later?" He rubs his lips with his hand from his opposite side, and he then lightly pats the fairy with it. "It won't be more than an hour. Let's remember that. I promise." 
Anya — 03/11/2022
"That sounds good, then... I'll lead you out and meet you at the gas station later. And give some thoughts to what you could be! But it's a hard choice, hmm. I'll give it thought~ Don't choke on your food if you're so intent on scarfing it down though. You're allowed to savor it a tiny little bit. People not knowing much about Fairies might make my presence kind of awkward, this is true." The fairy flops backwards off the shoulder and swoops around towards the direction they're headed. "I'll be buzzing about trying to spot a fruit or berry for the way back, if you don't mind."
Jaina — 03/11/2022
"Hey, I don't mind at all. Although now I have to wonder how much of the food pyramid a fairy partakes in, really." He keeps his eye on the fairy, although the movement is quite erratic. "I'll try to savor my food, and look, I promise that was the only near death experience I'll have for at least a while earlier. I'm not going to choke! Thank you for your concern though," He says, warmly. As they make it out to the edge of the parking lot, a couple more cars are situated in the parking lot than before. Shape glances at the chick working the register from yesterday walking out to her car, which she impatiently revs up and drives off. Shape then walks into the lot, calling behind him, "Alright, see you very soon, Anya, my lovely hero."
Anya — 03/11/2022
"Bye, come back soon~" The fairy blows a small kiss, a little flurry of sparkles appearing as he does. The gas station gal catches Anya's attention too, and she takes a small mental note. And she flutters off to enjoy a large strawberry and do her chores.
Jaina — 03/11/2022
---------------------
Shape's vehicle parks again into the lot, coming off from the highway. And he opens the door beside him, with the vehicle's lights left on, and stumbles out, putting a hand on his tummy. "Anya? Anya?" He says, glancing into the woods. He might honk the horn if needed.
Anya — 03/11/2022
A small display of floating, glowy orbs pull Shape's attention to a nearby tree, where Anya's perched on a branch and waving. He glides down and then reappears as a larger self, partially concealed behind a bush.

Shape smiles. "Oh, I knew you'd be here. Awesome. Well, I'm really full, I ate like two whole meals actually. So let's get in the car, what are we waiting for?" He walks over to take Anya's human-sized hand and, despite Anya's nakedness, take her into the driver's side seat with him.
Anya — 03/11/2022
As the car is freshly driven, it's a fair bit warmer than last time inside. Taking perch on Shape's lap, she leans in and hums delightfully. "You're baaack~ That's a lot of food! I hope it was good for you." She shifts and kisses on the chin.
Jaina — 03/11/2022
"It was pretty good. Ate like a large burger and fries and a large chicken salad. But anyway." He returns a kiss on Anya's nose, and then he squeezes Anya's waist with his hands. He'd like to touch her butt, too, sometime. And, for now, he finds now kissing the pink forest creature on the lips suitable. He closes his eyes and lets the moment hang for more than one of these kisses.
Anya — 03/11/2022
The fairy simply chimes in a small "bubger", then reciprocates kissing and indulges in the moment. His body doesn't hesitate in seeking close, pressed in very eagerly against Shape. It's a loving, hungry bit of affection, and with each kiss and moment the fairy wants less to leave the ShapeShifter's side. "Imagine if you didn't get yourself terribly hexed by doing, well, whatever you were doing. We wouldn't have this."
Jaina — 03/11/2022
Shape gasps from one of the especially hungry kisses from Anya, and he says in a sultry way, "Yeah. I don't even want to think about that. All that matters is we do have this... I have you." He commits to a few more demonstrations of physical affection, running his hand along Anya's bare bottom and even removing his own shirt. And then he says, "Oh, I think I might be getting ahead of myself, shouldn't I transform for you too? Did you come up with any ideas?" He smiles and squeezes her butt.
Anya — 03/11/2022
The more eager touches elicit some pleased sounds from the fairy, and she leans into Shape's bare chest once available. "Say, for simplicity's sake since it's someone we both know recently, you should try looking like the gal at the gas station. It'd be a curious look on you, hehe." She moans just gently, playfully at the squeeze, wiggling the butt. 
Jaina — 03/11/2022
He says, "Oh, I'd absolutely love to be her for you. I actually haven't tried being someone like her in a while, too. And I also sort of thought she was cute. So, give me a moment and maybe a little space~." He plays with Anya with another squeeze and short succession of kisses across her face, and then he scoots back on his seat, creating some distance from Anya. He closes his eyes and a cloud of beige sand starts to encompass the ShapeShifter, even scattering a bit on Anya, but it all magnetizes to Shape in the end. Shape's height is dramatically reduced in the blur to that of the woman's, and his profile becomes just as slim. Maybe even somewhat generically pretty, if either of them dare admit. Shape's clothes are replaced with tattered blue jeans and a dark shirt with a band's stencil, and instead of a belt there's some kind of metal chain with little loops. She has some tattoos of broken hearts and flowers at different stages of life and death crawling up her right arm, and she has three piercings on her ear. And her lips are completely black. She's a couple years younger than Shape just was biologically. The last of the magical whirlwind settles into Shape, and she's left blushing. "There'll be more time for me to be male later. Say hello to rebellious, cool, Lady Shape~."
Anya — 04/01/2022
Anya ends up hovering slighlty away from Shape as this goes on, and then slowly settles back down into the lap. "How fascinating, you just like her. Try not to to in there, they'll surely put you behind the counter for another few hours!" The fairy is a bit more blushy when she leans in for another quick kiss, somewhat taken by the fact that a small part of her brain feels like he's kissing a complete stranger. "Silly Lady Shape. You just took your shirt off. Why are you wearing a new one. Is that a bad girl thing to do~?" A hand presses against the now more full chest, for emphasis.
Jaina — 04/01/2022
She says, “Yeah, in retrospect making out in the parking lot of a stranger's work place is just a bit scandalous. Oh well.” Shape hums and indulges on more full kisses despite the change, and she plays more with Anya's butt and thigh. She giggles and says, “That was part of the package. But I don't see why I should keep wearing it now, good point~.” She lifts her band shirt over her black hair. “Clothes are quite stylish though, you should try them sometime.”
Anya — 04/01/2022
"I do suppose I could, the forest just doesn't often offer references or inspiration~" The freshly revealed chest gets a pair of almost just curious hands on them. Testing, to see how well the shapeshifting imitates nature. "Do you have a sense for how people's bodies are like, or do you make an educated guess? I assume you've probably never seen her nakey."
Jaina — 04/01/2022
“Oh, I dunno, I think there's plenty of outfits that imitate nature. Like dresses with flowers on them. But, well, you look great naked too, don't get me wrong.” She sighs out in comfort, and she flutters her eyelashes. She feels out Anya for her fairy clit, and she weighs two fingers on it. “Yeah, if I have good enough mental image of the appearance of someone it's less guesswork and more the DNA of the person filling out the gaps. Like their genetic code becomes part of the change in those understood cases, at least probably... All I know is I'm not trying to guess what these breasts looked like. In less understood cases, though, I will just have to guess. Anyway.” Her fingers tease the fairy.
Anya — 04/01/2022
There's a small little squeak from Anya, and she presses her face in. She knew things were headed that way but Shape doesn't seem to have that much time for hesitation. The fairy's face is adorably pink as he presses it against shape's shoulder, and mumbles. "Please... I need it, I need you. The forest can sometimes be a bit of a lonely place, y'know?" Her breath is warm and heavy, and he squirms a bit.
Jaina — 04/01/2022
She stares at the fairy below her in some amount of wonder. Nobody's ever been this forward and professing to her; it's always the other way around. She smiles and continues to tempt the possibility of fingering him. She keeps Anya snug, and she nuzzles into the pink hair. “I need you too. I've been so lonely too in that bland, heartless city... Do you really like me? Because I love you, Anya. And I'm going to be so sad when I go back.” She slides one digit slowly inside of Anya.
Anya — 04/01/2022
There's a slightly radiant warmth in Shape's arms, presumably that's just natural for an aroused fairy though. Hopefully. "You're so good to me, my heart aches to kiss you, It's been so little time but I have fallen for you. And right now, my body and senses long for exactly- A-ah~! That..." The slit is very receptive, having grown quite waiting from just the while of closeness in the car. "I almost want you to simply stay but... That isn't very feasible I suppose."
Jaina — 04/01/2022
“Eating at the restaurant earlier, I was having a bit of fantasies about the near future, and I had just the idea that might let me stay with you in the forest with only the occasional need to go to the civilized-- erm, human, world... Would that be all right, Anya, love?” She presses her finger further into the forest fairy and with less hesistation. “I've fallen for you too, my hero. How truly generous you are-- how warm and honest.”
Anya — 04/01/2022
Anya's hips shuffle about needily in Shape's lap, and more warm moans escape him. "How mean of you to make such propositions when I'm so affected by you, but do go on..." The nuzzles shift from the shoulder and over to Shape's neck, and a few loving kisses find their way there. His insides are warm, damp, eager for more.
Jaina — 04/01/2022
Her goth, pale face demonstrates a hue of pink with grace. She says, “I'll gather my important belongings and I'll camp out under your tree. I can get a very nice camping set, and like a cooler, I'll learn how to live like that.” And, in the meantime, she joins another finger in pumping in and out of his pussy. “It'd be worth it for you. And I would still be able to go get groceries and like your chocolate bars sometimes.”
Anya — 04/01/2022
"It could... Ahn.... Certainly be worth a try... Please, I j-just want more of you in my life." The nuzzling into the neck gets more firm as Shape's fingers set a deep warmth into Anya's body. "Nh, god... You've certainly done this before, haven't you?" There's a slight magical tingle that passes through Shape's fingers. It's truly a very mystical and powerful being that the fingers are currently inside.
Jaina — 04/01/2022
Shape can sense the magic is nothing short of the fairy's usual. She's beginning to find great comfort in sharing space with it. She hums, and she says with narrowing eyes, “I want more of you in mine, too, Anya. I really, really look forward to it. We'll have so much fun, cuddling, and sex... I have done this before, but never with someone as beautiful and understanding as you. I'd like to, for once, not think about the past?” She kisses Anya on her hair and forehead, and she streamlines her dormant hand across Anya's arching back.
Anya — 04/01/2022
Anya nods, and whispers a very small 'sorry'. He's a tad surprised that Shape's so direct about this probably becoming a recurring thing when they're together, but. Well. She's not wrong. They definitely would fuck more. He reaches his arms around Shape's neck, and presses close eagerly. Chest to chest, fairy to shapeshifter. A fast, excited and aroused breath interspersed with increasingly heavy moans. Shape's fingers and parts of the hand are now generously slick.
Jaina — 04/01/2022
Shape encourages a moan out of her own lips in response to Anya's moans and their contacting chests. She nuzzles the fairy's small arms with her cheek and chin, and she paces along the fingering fast and steady. She puts her free hand over her pink lips. “Let's savor this, Hero. I love you; I feel so alive.” Anya, even if elevated beyond human sexual limitations, crawls to a chaotic climax. The glow is visible from outside the car.
Anya — 04/01/2022
With a mostly lust-filled mind, Anya nuzzles into the hand and then takes her lips around one of the fingers, nibbling and licking it. She gasps past it, and his hips are swaying into the motion of the fingers now. "God... I'm going to... Soon... Please, no one has made me feel like this in a while, Thank you..." It truly isn't much left, delicate little noises in between the heavier sighs and moans. The magical stimulation is a vaguely perceivable buzz at this point - It's surprising how potent one small being of the woods can be.
Jaina — 04/01/2022
She stares into his eyes and giggles at his play with her fingers in front of their faces. And she pushes deeper sometimes inside the fairy, past Anya's comfortable region. It's never too far nor too long-- merely casual limit-testing that Shape gauges with fairy noises and expressions. Anya's stimulation and thoughts crawl all across her body as if they are lively little ants, and she finally falls over her tall edge-- she orgasms, writhing and writhing, her potent aura coming off in tangible, energized bursts that only serve to liven Shape and the scene. 
Anya — 04/01/2022
The depth of the fairy seem more receptive than one would expect, not showing much resistance as Shape pushes deeper. Anya progresses through a range of sounds before finally a long, whiny plea accompanies her exit, body trembling against her newfound lover, fairy glow glistening on and around them, thighs clamping against Shape's lap as the peak of bodily tension is passed over. And soon enough, the fairy sinks together, breaths slightly longer with each pass. 
"Oh, god..."
Jaina — 04/01/2022
She leaves her fingers inside of Anya for even some minutes before receding them. Shape's tattered jeans smell of sex. She licks her finger, blinks, and then rubs off the rest of the fairy cum on her fingers against Anya's cheek. “You are so, so sexy and precious. I've never had someone make such adorable noises for me. I hope I've satisfied you sexually for now, fairy. If I remember anything about fairies it's that they can spring back quickly from this kind of thing, right?” She presses her face against Anya's. 
Anya — 04/01/2022
"Do people say that about fairies, mmm? What very specific and odd things to have rumors about. But maybe there's some truth to it~ You'll find out soon enough." Anya nuzzles, ignoring that she's spreading the slickness on her cheek all over both of them. That's Shape's own fault. "For now, indeed, but who knows how long it'll suffice." Kiss.
Jaina — 04/01/2022
“...Oh, yeah, to be clear I'm not saying fairies or you are like supposed to be whores or anything like that. In fact, yeah, I'm not sure why those rumors exist. Maybe I just need to stop hanging around the mean crowd for information like this, huh? Like I said earlier, you've been defying every expectation.” Shape has little regard for the cum, and she kiss her lips again and again. She says, “Come on, babe, let's lower the seat.”
Anya — 04/01/2022
"That's the joy of being a mystical being, people come in with the wildest preconceptions and I can play around with those if I feel like it." He pushes against Shape's chest, enjoying the thought of more lying down on top of her. Kisses get returned as eagerly. "Don't be gone too long when you arrange your supplies, okay? I'll miss you."
Jaina — 04/01/2022
“Ah, see, that's one thing that was always true of fairies, though: you all definitely know how to be tricky. I could perhaps learn a thing or two from it. Seems fun.” She pulls the lever beside the seat and the two of them recline backwards. Shape wraps both arms around Anya's lower back, and she closes her eyes. ”I'll miss you too... I'll take only a couple days. I promise. I shouldn't have any much loose ends.”
Anya — 04/01/2022
The fairy yawns, and settles on top of the ShapeShifter. "Remember to bring snacks. And give some thought to anything you could try to amuse Yarrow with. Don't want to make her feel like the rare genuine charity went to waste." He nuzzles and kisses into anywhere she can reach.
Jaina — 04/01/2022
“Snacks it is... And honestly I'm a bit scared of Yarrow now that it's in the past, are you sure that I have to do that? She seems like she would genuinely hurt me if I upset her... In any case, what kind of stuff does she like? The human world has all kinds of stuff I could find her.” She yawns. She's not used to laying down with this many piercings.
Anya — 04/01/2022
"Oh, she's not outright scary or evil, but it'd be good to reward her for well. Taking part in saving you. It doesn't have to be anything excessive but something that makes her feel special of sorts? And do remember that she lives in a swamp. She could store it in a tree or something if it's not outright immune to being submerged but it needs to last some time through humid outside climates."
Jaina — 04/01/2022
“Right...” Shape sighs. “She did save my life too by extension of allowing us to get the necrolily. All right then, I guess I'll find something that makes her feel special, maybe a couple things. While I'm at it, I think I'll find something thematically appropriate as well for Ophelia. And I'll see what I have that you might like besides snacks.” 
Anya — 04/01/2022
The fairy mostly falls quiet, settling in. Coming down has probably made him sleepy.
